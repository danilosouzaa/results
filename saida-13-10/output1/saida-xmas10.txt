Problem xmas10 has 9080 rows, 8100 columns and 43635 elements
Coin0008I xmas10 read with 0 errors
maxNodes was changed from 2147483647 to 0
passCuts was changed from 20 to 1
Option for cutsOnOff changed from on to off
Option for knapsackCuts changed from off to on
Option for heuristicsOnOff changed from on to off
Option for preprocess changed from sos to off
seconds was changed from 1e+100 to 1200
Continuous objective value is -548.905 - 0.69 seconds
Cbc0031I 125 added rows had average density of 4
Cbc0013I At root node, 125 cuts changed objective from -548.90468 to -543.96758 in 1 passes
Cbc0014I Cut generator 0 (Knapsack) - 194 row cuts average 4.0 elements, 0 column cuts (0 active)  in 22.112 seconds - new frequency is 1
Cbc0003I Exiting on maximum nodes
Cbc0005I Partial search - best objective 1e+50 (best possible -543.96758), took 1221 iterations and 0 nodes (23.94 seconds)
Cbc0035I Maximum depth 0, 0 variables fixed on reduced cost
Cuts at root node changed objective from -548.905 to -543.968
Knapsack was tried 1 times and created 194 cuts of which 0 were active after adding rounds of cuts (22.112 seconds)

Result - Stopped on node limit

No feasible solution found
