seconds was changed from 1e+100 to 1200
Continuous objective value is 13.765 - 6.82 seconds
Cutoff increment increased from 0.0001 to 0.9999
Cbc0031I 42 added rows had average density of 13.02381
Cbc0013I At root node, 42 cuts changed objective from 13.765019 to 13.818317 in 1 passes
Cbc0014I Cut generator 0 (Knapsack) - 200 row cuts average 14.5 elements, 0 column cuts (0 active)  in 14.198 seconds - new frequency is 1
Cbc0003I Exiting on maximum nodes
Cbc0005I Partial search - best objective 1e+50 (best possible 13.818317), took 1009 iterations and 0 nodes (22.04 seconds)
Cbc0035I Maximum depth 0, 0 variables fixed on reduced cost
Cuts at root node changed objective from 13.765 to 13.8183
Knapsack was tried 1 times and created 200 cuts of which 0 were active after adding rounds of cuts (14.198 seconds)

Result - Stopped on node limit
