Continuous objective value is 480.25 - 1164.76 seconds
Cbc0013I At root node, 0 cuts changed objective from 480.25044 to 480.25044 in 1 passes
Cbc0014I Cut generator 0 (Knapsack) - 0 row cuts average 0.0 elements, 0 column cuts (0 active)  in 37.319 seconds - new frequency is 1000
Cbc0020I Exiting on maximum time
Cbc0005I Partial search - best objective 1e+50 (best possible 480.25044), took 0 iterations and 0 nodes (1203.83 seconds)
Cbc0035I Maximum depth 0, 0 variables fixed on reduced cost
Cuts at root node changed objective from 480.25 to 480.25
Knapsack was tried 1 times and created 0 cuts of which 0 were active after adding rounds of cuts (37.319 seconds)

Result - Stopped on time limit
