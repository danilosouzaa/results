seconds was changed from 1e+100 to 1200
Continuous objective value is -128 - 3.35 seconds
Cutoff increment increased from 0.0001 to 0.9999
Cbc0031I 14 added rows had average density of 126.14286
Cbc0013I At root node, 14 cuts changed objective from -128 to -128 in 1 passes
Cbc0014I Cut generator 0 (Knapsack) - 67 row cuts average 126.1 elements, 0 column cuts (0 active)  in 7.131 seconds - new frequency is 1
Cbc0003I Exiting on maximum nodes
Cbc0005I Partial search - best objective 1e+50 (best possible -128), took 14 iterations and 0 nodes (10.59 seconds)
Cbc0035I Maximum depth 0, 0 variables fixed on reduced cost
Cuts at root node changed objective from -128 to -128
Knapsack was tried 1 times and created 67 cuts of which 0 were active after adding rounds of cuts (7.131 seconds)

Result - Stopped on node limit
