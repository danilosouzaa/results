seconds was changed from 1e+100 to 1200
Continuous objective value is -99.92 - 5.71 seconds
Cbc0031I 13 added rows had average density of 3.0769231
Cbc0013I At root node, 13 cuts changed objective from -99.92 to -99.92 in 1 passes
Cbc0014I Cut generator 0 (Knapsack) - 42 row cuts average 3.7 elements, 0 column cuts (0 active)  in 0.858 seconds - new frequency is 1
Cbc0003I Exiting on maximum nodes
Cbc0005I Partial search - best objective 1e+50 (best possible -99.92), took 280 iterations and 0 nodes (7.42 seconds)
Cbc0035I Maximum depth 0, 0 variables fixed on reduced cost
Cuts at root node changed objective from -99.92 to -99.92
Knapsack was tried 1 times and created 42 cuts of which 0 were active after adding rounds of cuts (0.858 seconds)

Result - Stopped on node limit

No feasible solution found
