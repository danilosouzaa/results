Continuous objective value is -1256.94 - 0.49 seconds
Cutoff increment increased from 0.0001 to 0.9999
Cbc0031I 23 added rows had average density of 2
Cbc0013I At root node, 36 cuts changed objective from -1256.9429 to -1255.3333 in 1 passes
Cbc0014I Cut generator 0 (Knapsack) - 36 row cuts average 2.0 elements, 0 column cuts (0 active)  in 1.927 seconds - new frequency is 1
Cbc0001I Search completed - best objective 1e+50, took 1229 iterations and 0 nodes (4.24 seconds)
Cbc0035I Maximum depth 0, 0 variables fixed on reduced cost
Cuts at root node changed objective from -1256.94 to -1255.33
Knapsack was tried 1 times and created 36 cuts of which 0 were active after adding rounds of cuts (1.927 seconds)

Result - Problem proven infeasible
