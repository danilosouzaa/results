seconds was changed from 1e+100 to 1200
Continuous objective value is 13.8628 - 7.08 seconds
Cutoff increment increased from 0.0001 to 0.9999
Cbc0031I 1 added rows had average density of 32
Cbc0013I At root node, 1 cuts changed objective from 13.862841 to 13.862841 in 1 passes
Cbc0014I Cut generator 0 (Knapsack) - 2 row cuts average 31.0 elements, 0 column cuts (0 active)  in 0.369 seconds - new frequency is 1
Cbc0003I Exiting on maximum nodes
Cbc0005I Partial search - best objective 1e+50 (best possible 13.862841), took 3 iterations and 0 nodes (8.72 seconds)
Cbc0035I Maximum depth 0, 0 variables fixed on reduced cost
Cuts at root node changed objective from 13.8628 to 13.8628
Knapsack was tried 1 times and created 2 cuts of which 0 were active after adding rounds of cuts (0.369 seconds)

Result - Stopped on node limit

No feasible solution found
