seconds was changed from 1e+100 to 1200
Continuous objective value is 1.48183e+06 - 8.50 seconds
Cbc0031I 1 added rows had average density of 7
Cbc0013I At root node, 1 cuts changed objective from 2135657.6 to 2136819.1 in 1 passes
Cbc0014I Cut generator 0 (Knapsack) - 1 row cuts average 7.0 elements, 0 column cuts (0 active)  in 5.504 seconds - new frequency is 1
Cbc0003I Exiting on maximum nodes
Cbc0005I Partial search - best objective 1e+50 (best possible 2136819.1), took 890 iterations and 0 nodes (16.35 seconds)
Cbc0035I Maximum depth 0, 0 variables fixed on reduced cost
Cuts at root node changed objective from 2.11e+06 to 2.13682e+06
Knapsack was tried 1 times and created 1 cuts of which 0 were active after adding rounds of cuts (5.504 seconds)

Result - Stopped on node limit
