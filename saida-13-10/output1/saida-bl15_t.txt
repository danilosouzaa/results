seconds was changed from 1e+100 to 1200
Continuous objective value is 32220 - 2.03 seconds
Cutoff increment increased from 0.0001 to 0.9999
Cbc0031I 45 added rows had average density of 2.8222222
Cbc0013I At root node, 45 cuts changed objective from 33297 to 33699.409 in 1 passes
Cbc0014I Cut generator 0 (Knapsack) - 72 row cuts average 3.5 elements, 0 column cuts (0 active)  in 2.447 seconds - new frequency is 1
Cbc0003I Exiting on maximum nodes
Cbc0005I Partial search - best objective 1e+50 (best possible 33699.409), took 1281 iterations and 0 nodes (7.31 seconds)
Cbc0035I Maximum depth 0, 0 variables fixed on reduced cost
Cuts at root node changed objective from 33297 to 33699.4
Knapsack was tried 1 times and created 72 cuts of which 0 were active after adding rounds of cuts (2.447 seconds)

Result - Stopped on node limit
