seconds was changed from 1e+100 to 1200
Continuous objective value is -228.177 - 5.13 seconds
Cbc0031I 12 added rows had average density of 2.25
Cbc0013I At root node, 44 cuts changed objective from -228.17655 to -138.19141 in 1 passes
Cbc0014I Cut generator 0 (Knapsack) - 44 row cuts average 4.8 elements, 0 column cuts (0 active)  in 1.375 seconds - new frequency is 1
Cbc0001I Search completed - best objective 1e+50, took 5787 iterations and 0 nodes (17.71 seconds)
Cbc0035I Maximum depth 0, 0 variables fixed on reduced cost
Cuts at root node changed objective from -228.177 to -138.191
Knapsack was tried 1 times and created 44 cuts of which 0 were active after adding rounds of cuts (1.375 seconds)

Result - Problem proven infeasible
