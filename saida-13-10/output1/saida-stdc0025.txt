Continuous objective value is -1.74307e+06 - 1.90 seconds
Cutoff increment increased from 0.0001 to 0.9999
Cbc0031I 131 added rows had average density of 4.9007634
Cbc0013I At root node, 131 cuts changed objective from -1743072.6 to -1742963.2 in 1 passes
Cbc0014I Cut generator 0 (Knapsack) - 132 row cuts average 4.9 elements, 0 column cuts (0 active)  in 21.514 seconds - new frequency is 1
Cbc0003I Exiting on maximum nodes
Cbc0005I Partial search - best objective 1e+50 (best possible -1742963.2), took 375 iterations and 0 nodes (24.09 seconds)
Cbc0035I Maximum depth 0, 0 variables fixed on reduced cost
Cuts at root node changed objective from -1.74307e+06 to -1.74296e+06
Knapsack was tried 1 times and created 132 cuts of which 0 were active after adding rounds of cuts (21.514 seconds)
