Cbc0045I No integer variables out of 3745 objects (3745 integer) have costs
Cbc0045I branch on satisfied N create fake objective Y random cost Y
Cbc0013I At root node, 0 cuts changed objective from 0 to 0 in 1 passes
Cbc0014I Cut generator 0 (Knapsack) - 0 row cuts average 0.0 elements, 0 column cuts (0 active)  in 28.171 seconds - new frequency is 1000
