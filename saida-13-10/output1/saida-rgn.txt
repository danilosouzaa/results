seconds was changed from 1e+100 to 1200
Continuous objective value is 48.8 - 0.00 seconds
Cbc0031I 4 added rows had average density of 2.25
Cbc0013I At root node, 13 cuts changed objective from 48.799999 to 53.999999 in 1 passes
Cbc0014I Cut generator 0 (Knapsack) - 13 row cuts average 2.6 elements, 0 column cuts (0 active)  in 0.049 seconds - new frequency is 1
Cbc0001I Search completed - best objective 1e+50, took 17 iterations and 0 nodes (0.06 seconds)
Cbc0035I Maximum depth 0, 0 variables fixed on reduced cost
Cuts at root node changed objective from 48.8 to 54
Knapsack was tried 1 times and created 13 cuts of which 0 were active after adding rounds of cuts (0.049 seconds)
