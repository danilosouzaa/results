Cbc0031I 11 added rows had average density of 2.6363636
Cbc0013I At root node, 11 cuts changed objective from -6.4216796e+08 to -6.4216746e+08 in 1 passes
Cbc0014I Cut generator 0 (Knapsack) - 11 row cuts average 2.6 elements, 0 column cuts (0 active)  in 5.243 seconds - new frequency is 1
Cbc0003I Exiting on maximum nodes
Cbc0005I Partial search - best objective 1e+50 (best possible -6.4216746e+08), took 17 iterations and 0 nodes (6.91 seconds)
