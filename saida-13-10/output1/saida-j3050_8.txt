seconds was changed from 1e+100 to 1200
Continuous objective value is -3.55271e-15 - 0.01 seconds
Cutoff increment increased from 0.0001 to 0.9999
Cbc0031I 5 added rows had average density of 3.2
Cbc0013I At root node, 5 cuts changed objective from 0 to 0 in 1 passes
Cbc0014I Cut generator 0 (Knapsack) - 13 row cuts average 3.8 elements, 0 column cuts (0 active)  in 0.213 seconds - new frequency is 1
Cbc0003I Exiting on maximum nodes
Cbc0005I Partial search - best objective 1e+50 (best possible 0), took 24 iterations and 0 nodes (0.24 seconds)
Cbc0035I Maximum depth 0, 0 variables fixed on reduced cost
Cuts at root node changed objective from 0 to 0
Knapsack was tried 1 times and created 13 cuts of which 0 were active after adding rounds of cuts (0.213 seconds)

Result - Stopped on node limit
