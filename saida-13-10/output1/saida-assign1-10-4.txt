seconds was changed from 1e+100 to 1200
Continuous objective value is 353.993 - 0.80 seconds
Cutoff increment increased from 0.0001 to 0.9999
Cbc0031I 10 added rows had average density of 45.3
Cbc0013I At root node, 10 cuts changed objective from 353.99293 to 354.15167 in 1 passes
Cbc0014I Cut generator 0 (Knapsack) - 17 row cuts average 46.1 elements, 0 column cuts (0 active)  in 2.217 seconds - new frequency is 1
Cbc0003I Exiting on maximum nodes
Cbc0005I Partial search - best objective 1e+50 (best possible 354.15167), took 49 iterations and 0 nodes (3.33 seconds)
Cbc0035I Maximum depth 0, 0 variables fixed on reduced cost
Cuts at root node changed objective from 353.993 to 354.152
Knapsack was tried 1 times and created 17 cuts of which 0 were active after adding rounds of cuts (2.217 seconds)

Result - Stopped on node limit
