seconds was changed from 1e+100 to 1200
Continuous objective value is 405 - 0.69 seconds
Cutoff increment increased from 0.0001 to 0.9999
Cbc0031I 15 added rows had average density of 16.733333
Cbc0013I At root node, 36 cuts changed objective from 405 to 405 in 1 passes
Cbc0014I Cut generator 0 (Knapsack) - 36 row cuts average 17.4 elements, 0 column cuts (0 active)  in 8.008 seconds - new frequency is 1
Cbc0001I Search completed - best objective 1e+50, took 218 iterations and 0 nodes (10.16 seconds)
Cbc0035I Maximum depth 0, 0 variables fixed on reduced cost
Cuts at root node changed objective from 405 to 405
Knapsack was tried 1 times and created 36 cuts of which 0 were active after adding rounds of cuts (8.008 seconds)

Result - Problem proven infeasible
