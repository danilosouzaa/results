seconds was changed from 1e+100 to 1200
Continuous objective value is 179157 - 212.20 seconds
Cbc0031I 17 added rows had average density of 3.2941176
Cbc0013I At root node, 34 cuts changed objective from 179161.45 to 183769.9 in 1 passes
Cbc0014I Cut generator 0 (Knapsack) - 34 row cuts average 5.3 elements, 0 column cuts (0 active)  in 3.239 seconds - new frequency is 1
Cbc0001I Search completed - best objective 1e+50, took 45617 iterations and 0 nodes (353.82 seconds)
Cbc0035I Maximum depth 0, 0 variables fixed on reduced cost
Cuts at root node changed objective from 179161 to 183770
Knapsack was tried 1 times and created 34 cuts of which 0 were active after adding rounds of cuts (3.239 seconds)

Result - Problem proven infeasible
