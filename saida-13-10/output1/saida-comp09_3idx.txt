Continuous objective value is -3.99251e-11 - 56.86 seconds
Cbc0031I 23 added rows had average density of 29.391304
Cbc0013I At root node, 23 cuts changed objective from 0 to 0 in 1 passes
Cbc0014I Cut generator 0 (Knapsack) - 48 row cuts average 29.2 elements, 0 column cuts (0 active)  in 28.650 seconds - new frequency is 1
Cbc0003I Exiting on maximum nodes
Cbc0005I Partial search - best objective 1e+50 (best possible 0), took 3934 iterations and 0 nodes (212.98 seconds)
Cbc0035I Maximum depth 0, 0 variables fixed on reduced cost
Cuts at root node changed objective from 0 to 0
Knapsack was tried 1 times and created 48 cuts of which 0 were active after adding rounds of cuts (28.650 seconds)

Result - Stopped on node limit
