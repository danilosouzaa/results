seconds was changed from 1e+100 to 1200
Continuous objective value is 1697.73 - 0.00 seconds
Cutoff increment increased from 0.0001 to 0.9999
Cbc0031I 1 added rows had average density of 18
Cbc0013I At root node, 1 cuts changed objective from 1697.7273 to 1697.7692 in 1 passes
Cbc0014I Cut generator 0 (Knapsack) - 12 row cuts average 19.8 elements, 0 column cuts (0 active)  in 0.123 seconds - new frequency is 1
Cbc0003I Exiting on maximum nodes
Cbc0005I Partial search - best objective 1e+50 (best possible 1697.7692), took 1 iterations and 0 nodes (0.13 seconds)
Cbc0035I Maximum depth 0, 0 variables fixed on reduced cost
Cuts at root node changed objective from 1697.73 to 1697.77
Knapsack was tried 1 times and created 12 cuts of which 0 were active after adding rounds of cuts (0.123 seconds)

Result - Stopped on node limit
