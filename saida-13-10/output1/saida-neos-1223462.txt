seconds was changed from 1e+100 to 1200
Continuous objective value is -751 - 0.51 seconds
Cutoff increment increased from 0.0001 to 0.9999
Cbc0031I 43 added rows had average density of 2.0465116
Cbc0013I At root node, 62 cuts changed objective from -751 to -708.44444 in 1 passes
Cbc0014I Cut generator 0 (Knapsack) - 62 row cuts average 2.2 elements, 0 column cuts (0 active)  in 2.539 seconds - new frequency is 1
Cbc0001I Search completed - best objective 1e+50, took 4321 iterations and 0 nodes (11.10 seconds)
Cbc0035I Maximum depth 0, 0 variables fixed on reduced cost
Cuts at root node changed objective from -751 to -708.444
Knapsack was tried 1 times and created 62 cuts of which 0 were active after adding rounds of cuts (2.539 seconds)

Result - Problem proven infeasible
