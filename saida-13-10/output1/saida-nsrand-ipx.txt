Option for cutsOnOff changed from on to off
Option for knapsackCuts changed from off to on
Option for heuristicsOnOff changed from on to off
Option for preprocess changed from sos to off
seconds was changed from 1e+100 to 1200
Continuous objective value is 48880 - 0.31 seconds
Cbc0031I 23 added rows had average density of 2.5652174
Cbc0013I At root node, 23 cuts changed objective from 48880 to 59266.114 in 1 passes
Cbc0014I Cut generator 0 (Knapsack) - 40 row cuts average 3.0 elements, 0 column cuts (0 active)  in 1.122 seconds - new frequency is 1
Cbc0003I Exiting on maximum nodes
Cbc0005I Partial search - best objective 1e+50 (best possible 59266.114), took 161 iterations and 0 nodes (1.72 seconds)
Cbc0035I Maximum depth 0, 0 variables fixed on reduced cost
Cuts at root node changed objective from 48880 to 59266.1
Knapsack was tried 1 times and created 40 cuts of which 0 were active after adding rounds of cuts (1.122 seconds)

Result - Stopped on node limit
