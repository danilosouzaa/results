Continuous objective value is 174469 - 154.16 seconds
Cbc0031I 64 added rows had average density of 2.734375
Cbc0013I At root node, 116 cuts changed objective from 174469.01 to 255183.09 in 1 passes
Cbc0014I Cut generator 0 (Knapsack) - 116 row cuts average 2.9 elements, 0 column cuts (0 active)  in 9.272 seconds - new frequency is 1
Cbc0001I Search completed - best objective 1e+50, took 16040 iterations and 0 nodes (192.52 seconds)
Cbc0035I Maximum depth 0, 0 variables fixed on reduced cost
Cuts at root node changed objective from 174469 to 255183
Knapsack was tried 1 times and created 116 cuts of which 0 were active after adding rounds of cuts (9.272 seconds)
