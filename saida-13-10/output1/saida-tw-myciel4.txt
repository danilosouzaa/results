Cbc0045I 1 integer variables out of 760 objects (760 integer) have cost of 1 - high priority
Cbc0045I branch on satisfied Y create fake objective Y random cost Y
Cbc0013I At root node, 0 cuts changed objective from 3.8380282 to 3.8380282 in 1 passes
Cbc0014I Cut generator 0 (Knapsack) - 0 row cuts average 0.0 elements, 0 column cuts (0 active)  in 4.005 seconds - new frequency is 1000
