seconds was changed from 1e+100 to 1200
Continuous objective value is -321641 - 38.41 seconds
Cbc0031I 52 added rows had average density of 8.7115385
Cbc0013I At root node, 52 cuts changed objective from -321641.36 to -321557.06 in 1 passes
Cbc0014I Cut generator 0 (Knapsack) - 65 row cuts average 9.3 elements, 0 column cuts (0 active)  in 15.753 seconds - new frequency is 1
Cbc0003I Exiting on maximum nodes
Cbc0005I Partial search - best objective 1e+50 (best possible -321557.06), took 882 iterations and 0 nodes (57.42 seconds)
Cbc0035I Maximum depth 0, 0 variables fixed on reduced cost
Cuts at root node changed objective from -321641 to -321557
Knapsack was tried 1 times and created 65 cuts of which 0 were active after adding rounds of cuts (15.753 seconds)

Result - Stopped on node limit

No feasible solution found
