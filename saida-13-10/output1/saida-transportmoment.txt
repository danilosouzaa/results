Continuous objective value is -7.09295e+10 - 1.48 seconds
Cbc0013I At root node, 0 cuts changed objective from -6.9620743e+10 to -6.9620743e+10 in 1 passes
Cbc0014I Cut generator 0 (Knapsack) - 0 row cuts average 0.0 elements, 0 column cuts (0 active)  in 0.004 seconds - new frequency is 1000
Cbc0003I Exiting on maximum nodes
Cbc0005I Partial search - best objective 1e+50 (best possible -6.9620743e+10), took 0 iterations and 0 nodes (1.73 seconds)
