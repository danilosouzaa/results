seconds was changed from 1e+100 to 1200
Continuous objective value is 2 - 0.10 seconds
Cutoff increment increased from 0.0001 to 0.9999
Cbc0031I 54 added rows had average density of 3.0925926
Cbc0013I At root node, 54 cuts changed objective from 2 to 2 in 1 passes
Cbc0014I Cut generator 0 (Knapsack) - 150 row cuts average 3.7 elements, 0 column cuts (0 active)  in 1.957 seconds - new frequency is 1
Cbc0003I Exiting on maximum nodes
Cbc0005I Partial search - best objective 1e+50 (best possible 2), took 247 iterations and 0 nodes (2.19 seconds)
Cbc0035I Maximum depth 0, 0 variables fixed on reduced cost
Cuts at root node changed objective from 2 to 2
Knapsack was tried 1 times and created 150 cuts of which 0 were active after adding rounds of cuts (1.957 seconds)

Result - Stopped on node limit
