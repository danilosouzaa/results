Problem satellites3-25 has 44804 rows, 81681 columns and 698176 elements
Coin0008I satellites3-25 read with 0 errors
maxNodes was changed from 2147483647 to 0
passCuts was changed from 20 to 1
Option for cutsOnOff changed from on to off
Option for knapsackCuts changed from off to on
Option for heuristicsOnOff changed from on to off
Option for preprocess changed from sos to off
seconds was changed from 1e+100 to 1200
Continuous objective value is -39 - 105.70 seconds
Cbc0031I 13 added rows had average density of 19.769231
Cbc0013I At root node, 13 cuts changed objective from -39 to -39 in 1 passes
Cbc0014I Cut generator 0 (Knapsack) - 150 row cuts average 31.8 elements, 0 column cuts (0 active)  in 13.689 seconds - new frequency is 1
Cbc0003I Exiting on maximum nodes
Cbc0005I Partial search - best objective 1e+50 (best possible -39), took 14322 iterations and 0 nodes (243.91 seconds)
Cbc0035I Maximum depth 0, 0 variables fixed on reduced cost
Cuts at root node changed objective from -39 to -39
Knapsack was tried 1 times and created 150 cuts of which 0 were active after adding rounds of cuts (13.689 seconds)

Result - Stopped on node limit

No feasible solution found
