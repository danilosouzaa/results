seconds was changed from 1e+100 to 1200
Continuous objective value is 22721.3 - 0.05 seconds
Cbc0031I 5 added rows had average density of 4.4
Cbc0013I At root node, 5 cuts changed objective from 22721.328 to 22721.328 in 1 passes
Cbc0014I Cut generator 0 (Knapsack) - 14 row cuts average 4.0 elements, 0 column cuts (0 active)  in 0.069 seconds - new frequency is 1
Cbc0003I Exiting on maximum nodes
Cbc0005I Partial search - best objective 1e+50 (best possible 22721.328), took 12 iterations and 0 nodes (0.17 seconds)
Cbc0035I Maximum depth 0, 0 variables fixed on reduced cost
Cuts at root node changed objective from 22721.3 to 22721.3
Knapsack was tried 1 times and created 14 cuts of which 0 were active after adding rounds of cuts (0.069 seconds)

Result - Stopped on node limit
