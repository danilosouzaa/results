Cbc0045I 1 integer variables out of 16333 objects (15157 integer) have cost of 1 - high priority
Cbc0045I branch on satisfied N create fake objective N random cost N
Cbc0013I At root node, 0 cuts changed objective from 12225.487 to 12225.487 in 1 passes
Cbc0014I Cut generator 0 (Knapsack) - 0 row cuts average 0.0 elements, 0 column cuts (0 active)  in 3.792 seconds - new frequency is 1000
