Continuous objective value is -41.45 - 20.01 seconds
Cutoff increment increased from 0.0001 to 0.0999
Cbc0031I 1 added rows had average density of 29
Cbc0013I At root node, 1 cuts changed objective from -41.45 to -41.45 in 1 passes
Cbc0014I Cut generator 0 (Knapsack) - 1 row cuts average 29.0 elements, 0 column cuts (0 active)  in 2.690 seconds - new frequency is 1
Cbc0003I Exiting on maximum nodes
Cbc0005I Partial search - best objective 1e+50 (best possible -41.45), took 1515 iterations and 0 nodes (43.30 seconds)
Cbc0035I Maximum depth 0, 0 variables fixed on reduced cost
Cuts at root node changed objective from -41.45 to -41.45
Knapsack was tried 1 times and created 1 cuts of which 0 were active after adding rounds of cuts (2.690 seconds)

Result - Stopped on node limit
