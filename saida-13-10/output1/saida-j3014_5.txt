Cbc0045I No integer variables out of 496 objects (446 integer) have costs
Cbc0045I branch on satisfied N create fake objective Y random cost Y
Cbc0013I At root node, 0 cuts changed objective from 0 to 0 in 1 passes
Cbc0014I Cut generator 0 (Knapsack) - 31 row cuts average 6.6 elements, 0 column cuts (0 active)  in 0.567 seconds - new frequency is 1
Cbc0003I Exiting on maximum nodes
Cbc0005I Partial search - best objective 1e+50 (best possible 0), took 187 iterations and 0 nodes (0.61 seconds)
Cbc0035I Maximum depth 0, 0 variables fixed on reduced cost
Cuts at root node changed objective from 0 to 0
Knapsack was tried 1 times and created 31 cuts of which 0 were active after adding rounds of cuts (0.567 seconds)

Result - Stopped on node limit
