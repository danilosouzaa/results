seconds was changed from 1e+100 to 1200
Continuous objective value is 0 - 4.77 seconds
Cbc0031I 17 added rows had average density of 2.8823529
Cbc0013I At root node, 17 cuts changed objective from 0 to 0 in 1 passes
Cbc0014I Cut generator 0 (Knapsack) - 33 row cuts average 3.5 elements, 0 column cuts (0 active)  in 8.933 seconds - new frequency is 1
Cbc0003I Exiting on maximum nodes
Cbc0005I Partial search - best objective 1e+50 (best possible 0), took 723 iterations and 0 nodes (14.89 seconds)
Cbc0035I Maximum depth 0, 0 variables fixed on reduced cost
Cuts at root node changed objective from 0 to 0
Knapsack was tried 1 times and created 33 cuts of which 0 were active after adding rounds of cuts (8.933 seconds)

Result - Stopped on node limit
