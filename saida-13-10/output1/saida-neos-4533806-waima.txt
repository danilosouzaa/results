Continuous objective value is 3063.32 - 51.08 seconds
Cbc0031I 1 added rows had average density of 849
Cbc0013I At root node, 1 cuts changed objective from 3063.3188 to 3063.3188 in 1 passes
Cbc0014I Cut generator 0 (Knapsack) - 50 row cuts average 99.8 elements, 0 column cuts (0 active)  in 14.265 seconds - new frequency is 1
Cbc0003I Exiting on maximum nodes
Cbc0005I Partial search - best objective 1e+50 (best possible 3063.3188), took 2260 iterations and 0 nodes (89.30 seconds)
Cbc0035I Maximum depth 0, 0 variables fixed on reduced cost
Cuts at root node changed objective from 3063.32 to 3063.32
Knapsack was tried 1 times and created 50 cuts of which 0 were active after adding rounds of cuts (14.265 seconds)

Result - Stopped on node limit
