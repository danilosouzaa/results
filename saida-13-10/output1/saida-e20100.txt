Problem no_name has 120 rows, 2000 columns and 4000 elements
Coin0008I no_name read with 0 errors
maxNodes was changed from 2147483647 to 0
passCuts was changed from 20 to 1
Option for cutsOnOff changed from on to off
Option for knapsackCuts changed from off to on
Option for heuristicsOnOff changed from on to off

seconds was changed from 1e+100 to 1200
Continuous objective value is 8359.58 - 0.03 seconds
Cutoff increment increased from 0.0001 to 0.9999
Cbc0031I 16 added rows had average density of 6.125
Cbc0013I At root node, 16 cuts changed objective from 8359.582 to 8366.0897 in 1 passes
Cbc0014I Cut generator 0 (Knapsack) - 26 row cuts average 5.6 elements, 0 column cuts (0 active)  in 0.155 seconds - new frequency is 1
Cbc0003I Exiting on maximum nodes
Cbc0005I Partial search - best objective 1e+50 (best possible 8366.0897), took 46 iterations and 0 nodes (0.20 seconds)
Cbc0035I Maximum depth 0, 0 variables fixed on reduced cost
Cuts at root node changed objective from 8359.58 to 8366.09
Knapsack was tried 1 times and created 26 cuts of which 0 were active after adding rounds of cuts (0.155 seconds)

Result - Stopped on node limit
