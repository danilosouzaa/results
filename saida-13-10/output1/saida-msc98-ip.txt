seconds was changed from 1e+100 to 1200
Continuous objective value is 1.9521e+07 - 40.53 seconds
Cbc0031I 19 added rows had average density of 2.2105263
Cbc0013I At root node, 19 cuts changed objective from 19520966 to 19530315 in 1 passes
Cbc0014I Cut generator 0 (Knapsack) - 33 row cuts average 2.2 elements, 0 column cuts (0 active)  in 41.949 seconds - new frequency is 1
Cbc0003I Exiting on maximum nodes
Cbc0005I Partial search - best objective 1e+50 (best possible 19530315), took 8616 iterations and 0 nodes (98.76 seconds)
Cbc0035I Maximum depth 0, 0 variables fixed on reduced cost
Cuts at root node changed objective from 1.9521e+07 to 1.95303e+07
Knapsack was tried 1 times and created 33 cuts of which 0 were active after adding rounds of cuts (41.949 seconds)

Result - Stopped on node limit
