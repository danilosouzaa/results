passCuts was changed from 20 to 1
Option for cutsOnOff changed from on to off
Option for knapsackCuts changed from off to on
Option for heuristicsOnOff changed from on to off

seconds was changed from 1e+100 to 1200
Continuous objective value is 30 - 85.25 seconds
Cbc0031I 6 added rows had average density of 4.6666667
Cbc0013I At root node, 6 cuts changed objective from 30 to 30 in 1 passes
Cbc0014I Cut generator 0 (Knapsack) - 11 row cuts average 5.6 elements, 0 column cuts (0 active)  in 42.375 seconds - new frequency is 1
Cbc0003I Exiting on maximum nodes
Cbc0005I Partial search - best objective 1e+50 (best possible 30), took 813 iterations and 0 nodes (142.70 seconds)
Cbc0035I Maximum depth 0, 0 variables fixed on reduced cost
Cuts at root node changed objective from 30 to 30
Knapsack was tried 1 times and created 11 cuts of which 0 were active after adding rounds of cuts (42.375 seconds)

Result - Stopped on node limit
