Option for heuristicsOnOff changed from on to off
Option for preprocess changed from sos to off
seconds was changed from 1e+100 to 1200
Continuous objective value is 1666.07 - 0.35 seconds
Cbc0031I 3 added rows had average density of 6.6666667
Cbc0013I At root node, 3 cuts changed objective from 1666.0686 to 2077.948 in 1 passes
Cbc0014I Cut generator 0 (Knapsack) - 7 row cuts average 9.7 elements, 0 column cuts (0 active)  in 3.735 seconds - new frequency is 1
Cbc0003I Exiting on maximum nodes
Cbc0005I Partial search - best objective 1e+50 (best possible 2077.948), took 125 iterations and 0 nodes (4.55 seconds)
Cbc0035I Maximum depth 0, 0 variables fixed on reduced cost
Cuts at root node changed objective from 1666.07 to 2077.95
Knapsack was tried 1 times and created 7 cuts of which 0 were active after adding rounds of cuts (3.735 seconds)

Result - Stopped on node limit
