seconds was changed from 1e+100 to 1200
Continuous objective value is 11580 - 1.31 seconds
Cutoff increment increased from 0.0001 to 0.9999
Cbc0031I 2 added rows had average density of 3
Cbc0013I At root node, 2 cuts changed objective from 11580 to 11580 in 1 passes
Cbc0014I Cut generator 0 (Knapsack) - 4 row cuts average 2.8 elements, 0 column cuts (0 active)  in 1.699 seconds - new frequency is 1
Cbc0003I Exiting on maximum nodes
Cbc0005I Partial search - best objective 1e+50 (best possible 11580), took 45 iterations and 0 nodes (3.85 seconds)
Cbc0035I Maximum depth 0, 0 variables fixed on reduced cost
Cuts at root node changed objective from 11580 to 11580
Knapsack was tried 1 times and created 4 cuts of which 0 were active after adding rounds of cuts (1.699 seconds)

Result - Stopped on node limit

No feasible solution found
