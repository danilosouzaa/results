Continuous objective value is 17554.5 - 1.08 seconds
Cbc0045I 1 integer variables out of 25935 objects (22841 integer) have cost of 1 - high priority
Cbc0045I branch on satisfied N create fake objective N random cost N
Cbc0031I 59 added rows had average density of 2.3728814
Cbc0013I At root node, 59 cuts changed objective from 17560.854 to 17560.949 in 1 passes
Cbc0014I Cut generator 0 (Knapsack) - 83 row cuts average 2.3 elements, 0 column cuts (0 active)  in 14.614 seconds - new frequency is 1
Cbc0003I Exiting on maximum nodes
Cbc0005I Partial search - best objective 1e+50 (best possible 17560.949), took 426 iterations and 0 nodes (18.98 seconds)
Cbc0035I Maximum depth 0, 0 variables fixed on reduced cost
Cuts at root node changed objective from 17560.9 to 17560.9
Knapsack was tried 1 times and created 83 cuts of which 0 were active after adding rounds of cuts (14.614 seconds)

Result - Stopped on node limit
