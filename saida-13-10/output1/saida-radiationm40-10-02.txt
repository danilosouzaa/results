Continuous objective value is 155307 - 6.97 seconds
Cbc0045I 1 integer variables out of 109613 objects (96468 integer) have cost of 1 - high priority
Cbc0045I branch on satisfied N create fake objective N random cost N
Cbc0031I 14 added rows had average density of 2
Cbc0013I At root node, 14 cuts changed objective from 155317.68 to 155317.68 in 1 passes
Cbc0014I Cut generator 0 (Knapsack) - 14 row cuts average 2.0 elements, 0 column cuts (0 active)  in 42.676 seconds - new frequency is 1
Cbc0003I Exiting on maximum nodes
Cbc0005I Partial search - best objective 1e+50 (best possible 155317.68), took 112 iterations and 0 nodes (72.27 seconds)
Cbc0035I Maximum depth 0, 0 variables fixed on reduced cost
Cuts at root node changed objective from 155318 to 155318
Knapsack was tried 1 times and created 14 cuts of which 0 were active after adding rounds of cuts (42.676 seconds)
