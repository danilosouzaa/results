Continuous objective value is -70.9127 - 6.93 seconds
Cutoff increment increased from 0.0001 to 0.9999
Cbc0031I 118 added rows had average density of 91.254237
Cbc0013I At root node, 118 cuts changed objective from -70.912689 to -70.706089 in 1 passes
Cbc0014I Cut generator 0 (Knapsack) - 354 row cuts average 91.3 elements, 0 column cuts (0 active)  in 60.146 seconds - new frequency is 1
Cbc0003I Exiting on maximum nodes
Cbc0005I Partial search - best objective 1e+50 (best possible -70.706089), took 118 iterations and 0 nodes (69.29 seconds)
