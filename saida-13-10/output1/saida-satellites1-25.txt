seconds was changed from 1e+100 to 1200
Continuous objective value is -20 - 0.68 seconds
Cbc0031I 3 added rows had average density of 4.6666667
Cbc0013I At root node, 3 cuts changed objective from -20 to -20 in 1 passes
Cbc0014I Cut generator 0 (Knapsack) - 11 row cuts average 5.2 elements, 0 column cuts (0 active)  in 0.592 seconds - new frequency is 1
Cbc0003I Exiting on maximum nodes
Cbc0005I Partial search - best objective 1e+50 (best possible -20), took 249 iterations and 0 nodes (1.58 seconds)
Cbc0035I Maximum depth 0, 0 variables fixed on reduced cost
Cuts at root node changed objective from -20 to -20
Knapsack was tried 1 times and created 11 cuts of which 0 were active after adding rounds of cuts (0.592 seconds)

Result - Stopped on node limit
