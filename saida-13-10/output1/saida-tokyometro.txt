seconds was changed from 1e+100 to 1200
Continuous objective value is 285.156 - 0.21 seconds
Cbc0031I 28 added rows had average density of 2
Cbc0013I At root node, 28 cuts changed objective from 1540.0872 to 1652.3365 in 1 passes
Cbc0014I Cut generator 0 (Knapsack) - 28 row cuts average 2.0 elements, 0 column cuts (0 active)  in 2.123 seconds - new frequency is 1
Cbc0003I Exiting on maximum nodes
Cbc0005I Partial search - best objective 1e+50 (best possible 1652.3365), took 61 iterations and 0 nodes (2.93 seconds)
Cbc0035I Maximum depth 0, 0 variables fixed on reduced cost
Cuts at root node changed objective from 1540.09 to 1652.34
Knapsack was tried 1 times and created 28 cuts of which 0 were active after adding rounds of cuts (2.123 seconds)

Result - Stopped on node limit
