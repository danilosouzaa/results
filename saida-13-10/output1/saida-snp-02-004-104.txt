Continuous objective value is 5.48045e+08 - 17.88 seconds
Cbc0013I At root node, 0 cuts changed objective from 5.604902e+08 to 5.604902e+08 in 1 passes
Cbc0014I Cut generator 0 (Knapsack) - 0 row cuts average 0.0 elements, 0 column cuts (0 active)  in 0.084 seconds - new frequency is 1000
Cbc0003I Exiting on maximum nodes
Cbc0005I Partial search - best objective 1e+50 (best possible 5.604902e+08), took 0 iterations and 0 nodes (20.19 seconds)
