Continuous objective value is 2.43139e-14 - 16.58 seconds
Cbc0031I 2 added rows had average density of 13.5
Cbc0013I At root node, 5 cuts changed objective from 2.4313884e-14 to 8.6597396e-15 in 1 passes
Cbc0014I Cut generator 0 (Knapsack) - 5 row cuts average 13.6 elements, 0 column cuts (0 active)  in 4.661 seconds - new frequency is 1
Cbc0001I Search completed - best objective 1e+50, took 43 iterations and 0 nodes (27.98 seconds)
Cbc0035I Maximum depth 0, 0 variables fixed on reduced cost
Cuts at root node changed objective from 2.43139e-14 to 8.65974e-15
Knapsack was tried 1 times and created 5 cuts of which 0 were active after adding rounds of cuts (4.661 seconds)
