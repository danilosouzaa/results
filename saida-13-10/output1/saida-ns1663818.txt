seconds was changed from 1e+100 to 1200
Continuous objective value is 1 - 322.64 seconds
Cbc0031I 4 added rows had average density of 2
Cbc0013I At root node, 4 cuts changed objective from 1 to 1 in 1 passes
Cbc0014I Cut generator 0 (Knapsack) - 4 row cuts average 2.0 elements, 0 column cuts (0 active)  in 44.885 seconds - new frequency is 1
Cbc0003I Exiting on maximum nodes
Cbc0005I Partial search - best objective 1e+50 (best possible 1), took 192 iterations and 0 nodes (603.68 seconds)
Cbc0035I Maximum depth 0, 0 variables fixed on reduced cost
Cuts at root node changed objective from 1 to 1
Knapsack was tried 1 times and created 4 cuts of which 0 were active after adding rounds of cuts (44.885 seconds)

Result - Stopped on node limit
