Continuous objective value is 5.60004e+06 - 0.66 seconds
Cutoff increment increased from 0.0001 to 0.9999
Cbc0031I 9 added rows had average density of 4.3333333
Cbc0013I At root node, 9 cuts changed objective from 5600038 to 5600038 in 1 passes
Cbc0014I Cut generator 0 (Knapsack) - 16 row cuts average 4.7 elements, 0 column cuts (0 active)  in 0.591 seconds - new frequency is 1
Cbc0003I Exiting on maximum nodes
Cbc0005I Partial search - best objective 1e+50 (best possible 5600038), took 68 iterations and 0 nodes (1.87 seconds)
Cbc0035I Maximum depth 0, 0 variables fixed on reduced cost
Cuts at root node changed objective from 5.60004e+06 to 5.60004e+06
Knapsack was tried 1 times and created 16 cuts of which 0 were active after adding rounds of cuts (0.591 seconds)

Result - Stopped on node limit
