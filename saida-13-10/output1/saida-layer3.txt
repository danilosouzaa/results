Continuous objective value is -3.72454e+09 - 0.06 seconds
Cutoff increment increased from 0.0001 to 0.9999
Cbc0031I 6 added rows had average density of 38.166667
Cbc0013I At root node, 6 cuts changed objective from -3.72454e+09 to -3.7145502e+09 in 1 passes
Cbc0014I Cut generator 0 (Knapsack) - 35 row cuts average 41.6 elements, 0 column cuts (0 active)  in 1.031 seconds - new frequency is 1
Cbc0003I Exiting on maximum nodes
Cbc0005I Partial search - best objective 1e+50 (best possible -3.7145502e+09), took 372 iterations and 0 nodes (1.16 seconds)
Cbc0035I Maximum depth 0, 0 variables fixed on reduced cost
Cuts at root node changed objective from -3.72454e+09 to -3.71455e+09
Knapsack was tried 1 times and created 35 cuts of which 0 were active after adding rounds of cuts (1.031 seconds)
