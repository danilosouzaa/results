Cbc0045I 1 integer variables out of 11635 objects (9930 integer) have cost of 1 - high priority
Cbc0045I branch on satisfied N create fake objective N random cost N
Cbc0013I At root node, 0 cuts changed objective from 7114.21 to 7114.21 in 1 passes
Cbc0014I Cut generator 0 (Knapsack) - 0 row cuts average 0.0 elements, 0 column cuts (0 active)  in 1.815 seconds - new frequency is 1000
Cbc0003I Exiting on maximum nodes
Cbc0005I Partial search - best objective 1e+50 (best possible 7114.21), took 0 iterations and 0 nodes (7.84 seconds)
Cbc0035I Maximum depth 0, 0 variables fixed on reduced cost
Cuts at root node changed objective from 7114.21 to 7114.21
Knapsack was tried 1 times and created 0 cuts of which 0 were active after adding rounds of cuts (1.815 seconds)

Result - Stopped on node limit
