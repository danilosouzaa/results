seconds was changed from 1e+100 to 1200
Continuous objective value is -286924 - 2.02 seconds
Cbc0031I 8 added rows had average density of 16.875
Cbc0013I At root node, 8 cuts changed objective from -286923.82 to -286923.08 in 1 passes
Cbc0014I Cut generator 0 (Knapsack) - 15 row cuts average 18.8 elements, 0 column cuts (0 active)  in 2.489 seconds - new frequency is 1
Cbc0003I Exiting on maximum nodes
Cbc0005I Partial search - best objective 1e+50 (best possible -286923.08), took 37 iterations and 0 nodes (5.70 seconds)
Cbc0035I Maximum depth 0, 0 variables fixed on reduced cost
Cuts at root node changed objective from -286924 to -286923
Knapsack was tried 1 times and created 15 cuts of which 0 were active after adding rounds of cuts (2.489 seconds)

Result - Stopped on node limit

No feasible solution found
