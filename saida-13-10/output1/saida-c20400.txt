seconds was changed from 1e+100 to 1200
Continuous objective value is 4774.15 - 0.05 seconds
Cutoff increment increased from 0.0001 to 0.9999
Cbc0031I 12 added rows had average density of 19.666667
Cbc0013I At root node, 12 cuts changed objective from 4774.1504 to 4775.0389 in 1 passes
Cbc0014I Cut generator 0 (Knapsack) - 88 row cuts average 20.2 elements, 0 column cuts (0 active)  in 0.609 seconds - new frequency is 1
Cbc0003I Exiting on maximum nodes
Cbc0005I Partial search - best objective 1e+50 (best possible 4775.0389), took 39 iterations and 0 nodes (0.72 seconds)
Cbc0035I Maximum depth 0, 0 variables fixed on reduced cost
Cuts at root node changed objective from 4774.15 to 4775.04
Knapsack was tried 1 times and created 88 cuts of which 0 were active after adding rounds of cuts (0.609 seconds)

Result - Stopped on node limit
