seconds was changed from 1e+100 to 1200
Continuous objective value is -432166 - 99.49 seconds
Cbc0031I 65 added rows had average density of 8.0923077
Cbc0013I At root node, 65 cuts changed objective from -406658.18 to -406409.85 in 1 passes
Cbc0014I Cut generator 0 (Knapsack) - 77 row cuts average 8.4 elements, 0 column cuts (0 active)  in 30.653 seconds - new frequency is 1
Cbc0003I Exiting on maximum nodes
Cbc0005I Partial search - best objective 1e+50 (best possible -406409.85), took 1929 iterations and 0 nodes (149.05 seconds)
Cbc0035I Maximum depth 0, 0 variables fixed on reduced cost
Cuts at root node changed objective from -406658 to -406410
Knapsack was tried 1 times and created 77 cuts of which 0 were active after adding rounds of cuts (30.653 seconds)

Result - Stopped on node limit
