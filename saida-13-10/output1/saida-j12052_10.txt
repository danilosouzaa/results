Continuous objective value is 11.3428 - 108.12 seconds
Cutoff increment increased from 0.0001 to 0.9999
Cbc0031I 21 added rows had average density of 13.190476
Cbc0013I At root node, 21 cuts changed objective from 11.342799 to 11.370051 in 1 passes
Cbc0014I Cut generator 0 (Knapsack) - 66 row cuts average 15.7 elements, 0 column cuts (0 active)  in 19.566 seconds - new frequency is 1
Cbc0003I Exiting on maximum nodes
Cbc0005I Partial search - best objective 1e+50 (best possible 11.370051), took 1501 iterations and 0 nodes (131.52 seconds)
