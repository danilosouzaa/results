Continuous objective value is 3758.75 - 1.50 seconds
Cbc0013I At root node, 0 cuts changed objective from 3758.7532 to 3758.7532 in 1 passes
Cbc0014I Cut generator 0 (Knapsack) - 0 row cuts average 0.0 elements, 0 column cuts (0 active)  in 0.450 seconds - new frequency is 1000
Cbc0003I Exiting on maximum nodes
Cbc0005I Partial search - best objective 1e+50 (best possible 3758.7532), took 0 iterations and 0 nodes (2.98 seconds)
Cbc0035I Maximum depth 0, 0 variables fixed on reduced cost
Cuts at root node changed objective from 3758.75 to 3758.75
