Continuous objective value is -6.48197e-13 - 433.88 seconds
Cbc0031I 80 added rows had average density of 26.4875
Cbc0013I At root node, 80 cuts changed objective from 0 to 0 in 1 passes
Cbc0014I Cut generator 0 (Knapsack) - 80 row cuts average 26.5 elements, 0 column cuts (0 active)  in 42.251 seconds - new frequency is 1
Cbc0020I Exiting on maximum time
Cbc0005I Partial search - best objective 1e+50 (best possible 0), took 14502 iterations and 0 nodes (1209.31 seconds)
Cbc0035I Maximum depth 0, 0 variables fixed on reduced cost
Cuts at root node changed objective from 0 to 0
Knapsack was tried 1 times and created 80 cuts of which 0 were active after adding rounds of cuts (42.251 seconds)

Result - Stopped on time limit
