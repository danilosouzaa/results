seconds was changed from 1e+100 to 1200
Continuous objective value is 248.325 - 0.11 seconds
Cutoff increment increased from 0.0001 to 0.00999
Cbc0031I 8 added rows had average density of 38.25
Cbc0013I At root node, 8 cuts changed objective from 248.325 to 248.325 in 1 passes
Cbc0014I Cut generator 0 (Knapsack) - 8 row cuts average 38.2 elements, 0 column cuts (0 active)  in 1.123 seconds - new frequency is 1
Cbc0003I Exiting on maximum nodes
Cbc0005I Partial search - best objective 1e+50 (best possible 248.325), took 9 iterations and 0 nodes (1.28 seconds)
Cbc0035I Maximum depth 0, 0 variables fixed on reduced cost
Cuts at root node changed objective from 248.325 to 248.325
Knapsack was tried 1 times and created 8 cuts of which 0 were active after adding rounds of cuts (1.123 seconds)

Result - Stopped on node limit
