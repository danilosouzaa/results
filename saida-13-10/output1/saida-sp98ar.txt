seconds was changed from 1e+100 to 1200
Continuous objective value is 5.21034e+08 - 2.10 seconds
Cbc0031I 10 added rows had average density of 6.4
Cbc0013I At root node, 10 cuts changed objective from 5.2103372e+08 to 5.2129653e+08 in 1 passes
Cbc0014I Cut generator 0 (Knapsack) - 12 row cuts average 7.0 elements, 0 column cuts (0 active)  in 0.955 seconds - new frequency is 1
Cbc0003I Exiting on maximum nodes
Cbc0005I Partial search - best objective 1e+50 (best possible 5.2129653e+08), took 456 iterations and 0 nodes (3.80 seconds)
Cbc0035I Maximum depth 0, 0 variables fixed on reduced cost
Cuts at root node changed objective from 5.21034e+08 to 5.21297e+08
Knapsack was tried 1 times and created 12 cuts of which 0 were active after adding rounds of cuts (0.955 seconds)

Result - Stopped on node limit
