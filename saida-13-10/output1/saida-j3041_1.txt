seconds was changed from 1e+100 to 1200
Continuous objective value is 0.123896 - 0.06 seconds
Cutoff increment increased from 0.0001 to 0.9999
Cbc0031I 12 added rows had average density of 4.25
Cbc0013I At root node, 12 cuts changed objective from 0.12389598 to 0.14625433 in 1 passes
Cbc0014I Cut generator 0 (Knapsack) - 34 row cuts average 4.9 elements, 0 column cuts (0 active)  in 0.582 seconds - new frequency is 1
Cbc0003I Exiting on maximum nodes
Cbc0005I Partial search - best objective 1e+50 (best possible 0.14625433), took 50 iterations and 0 nodes (0.66 seconds)
Cbc0035I Maximum depth 0, 0 variables fixed on reduced cost
Cuts at root node changed objective from 0.123896 to 0.146254
Knapsack was tried 1 times and created 34 cuts of which 0 were active after adding rounds of cuts (0.582 seconds)

Result - Stopped on node limit
