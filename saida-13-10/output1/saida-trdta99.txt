seconds was changed from 1e+100 to 1200
Continuous objective value is 225365 - 6.98 seconds
Cutoff increment increased from 0.0001 to 0.0666
Cbc0031I 20 added rows had average density of 6.2
Cbc0013I At root node, 20 cuts changed objective from 225364.88 to 225364.96 in 1 passes
Cbc0014I Cut generator 0 (Knapsack) - 28 row cuts average 6.4 elements, 0 column cuts (0 active)  in 3.252 seconds - new frequency is 1
Cbc0003I Exiting on maximum nodes
Cbc0005I Partial search - best objective 1e+50 (best possible 225364.96), took 412 iterations and 0 nodes (11.02 seconds)
Cbc0035I Maximum depth 0, 0 variables fixed on reduced cost
Cuts at root node changed objective from 225365 to 225365
Knapsack was tried 1 times and created 28 cuts of which 0 were active after adding rounds of cuts (3.252 seconds)

Result - Stopped on node limit
