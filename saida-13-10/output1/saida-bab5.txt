Problem bab5 has 4964 rows, 21600 columns and 155520 elements
Coin0008I bab5 read with 0 errors
maxNodes was changed from 2147483647 to 0
passCuts was changed from 20 to 1
Option for cutsOnOff changed from on to off
Option for knapsackCuts changed from off to on
Option for heuristicsOnOff changed from on to off
Option for preprocess changed from sos to off
seconds was changed from 1e+100 to 1200
Continuous objective value is -124658 - 2.55 seconds
Cbc0031I 18 added rows had average density of 8.5555556
Cbc0013I At root node, 18 cuts changed objective from -124657.64 to -124590.73 in 1 passes
Cbc0014I Cut generator 0 (Knapsack) - 19 row cuts average 8.7 elements, 0 column cuts (0 active)  in 0.926 seconds - new frequency is 1
Cbc0003I Exiting on maximum nodes
Cbc0005I Partial search - best objective 1e+50 (best possible -124590.73), took 169 iterations and 0 nodes (3.81 seconds)
Cbc0035I Maximum depth 0, 0 variables fixed on reduced cost
Cuts at root node changed objective from -124658 to -124591
Knapsack was tried 1 times and created 19 cuts of which 0 were active after adding rounds of cuts (0.926 seconds)

Result - Stopped on node limit

No feasible solution found
