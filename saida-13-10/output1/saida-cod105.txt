Cbc0013I At root node, 0 cuts changed objective from -18.285714 to -18.285714 in 1 passes
Cbc0014I Cut generator 0 (Knapsack) - 0 row cuts average 0.0 elements, 0 column cuts (0 active)  in 0.004 seconds - new frequency is 1000
Cbc0003I Exiting on maximum nodes
Cbc0005I Partial search - best objective 1e+50 (best possible -18.285714), took 0 iterations and 0 nodes (9.48 seconds)
