Continuous objective value is 4.44278e+08 - 0.60 seconds
Cbc0031I 1 added rows had average density of 2
Cbc0013I At root node, 1 cuts changed objective from 4.4427757e+08 to 4.4441888e+08 in 1 passes
Cbc0014I Cut generator 0 (Knapsack) - 1 row cuts average 2.0 elements, 0 column cuts (0 active)  in 0.133 seconds - new frequency is 1
Cbc0003I Exiting on maximum nodes
Cbc0005I Partial search - best objective 1e+50 (best possible 4.4441888e+08), took 56 iterations and 0 nodes (1.06 seconds)
Cbc0035I Maximum depth 0, 0 variables fixed on reduced cost
Cuts at root node changed objective from 4.44278e+08 to 4.44419e+08
Knapsack was tried 1 times and created 1 cuts of which 0 were active after adding rounds of cuts (0.133 seconds)

Result - Stopped on node limit
