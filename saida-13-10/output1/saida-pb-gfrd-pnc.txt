Continuous objective value is 8316.01 - 0.33 seconds
Cbc0031I 119 added rows had average density of 3.7226891
Cbc0013I At root node, 1017 cuts changed objective from 8321.1132 to 20281.935 in 1 passes
Cbc0014I Cut generator 0 (Knapsack) - 1017 row cuts average 13.1 elements, 0 column cuts (0 active)  in 6.684 seconds - new frequency is 1
Cbc0001I Search completed - best objective 1e+50, took 10794 iterations and 0 nodes (12.03 seconds)
Cbc0035I Maximum depth 0, 0 variables fixed on reduced cost
Cuts at root node changed objective from 8320.44 to 20281.9
Knapsack was tried 1 times and created 1017 cuts of which 0 were active after adding rounds of cuts (6.684 seconds)
