seconds was changed from 1e+100 to 1200
Continuous objective value is 43.8936 - 24.05 seconds
Cbc0031I 14 added rows had average density of 5.2857143
Cbc0013I At root node, 14 cuts changed objective from 43.893576 to 44.418706 in 1 passes
Cbc0014I Cut generator 0 (Knapsack) - 123 row cuts average 22.1 elements, 0 column cuts (0 active)  in 35.655 seconds - new frequency is 1
Cbc0003I Exiting on maximum nodes
Cbc0005I Partial search - best objective 1e+50 (best possible 44.418706), took 2451 iterations and 0 nodes (65.94 seconds)
Cbc0035I Maximum depth 0, 0 variables fixed on reduced cost
Cuts at root node changed objective from 43.8936 to 44.4187
Knapsack was tried 1 times and created 123 cuts of which 0 were active after adding rounds of cuts (35.655 seconds)
