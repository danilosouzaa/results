seconds was changed from 1e+100 to 1200
Continuous objective value is 102.6 - 5.47 seconds
Cutoff increment increased from 0.0001 to 0.9999
Cbc0031I 9 added rows had average density of 13.555556
Cbc0013I At root node, 21 cuts changed objective from 102.6 to 102.6 in 1 passes
Cbc0014I Cut generator 0 (Knapsack) - 21 row cuts average 15.1 elements, 0 column cuts (0 active)  in 18.621 seconds - new frequency is 1
Cbc0001I Search completed - best objective 1e+50, took 1686 iterations and 0 nodes (26.07 seconds)
Cbc0035I Maximum depth 0, 0 variables fixed on reduced cost
Cuts at root node changed objective from 102.6 to 102.6
Knapsack was tried 1 times and created 21 cuts of which 0 were active after adding rounds of cuts (18.621 seconds)

Result - Problem proven infeasible
