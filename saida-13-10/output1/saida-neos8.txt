Cbc0031I 19 added rows had average density of 2.9473684
Cbc0013I At root node, 19 cuts changed objective from -3773.5079 to -3773.4142 in 1 passes
Cbc0014I Cut generator 0 (Knapsack) - 19 row cuts average 2.9 elements, 0 column cuts (0 active)  in 19.466 seconds - new frequency is 1
Cbc0003I Exiting on maximum nodes
Cbc0005I Partial search - best objective 1e+50 (best possible -3773.4142), took 21 iterations and 0 nodes (29.70 seconds)
