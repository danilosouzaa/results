Continuous objective value is -3.9366e+07 - 0.31 seconds
Cbc0013I At root node, 0 cuts changed objective from -39365983 to -39365983 in 1 passes
Cbc0014I Cut generator 0 (Knapsack) - 0 row cuts average 0.0 elements, 0 column cuts (0 active)  in 0.026 seconds - new frequency is 1000
Cbc0003I Exiting on maximum nodes
Cbc0005I Partial search - best objective 1e+50 (best possible -39365983), took 0 iterations and 0 nodes (0.39 seconds)
Cbc0035I Maximum depth 0, 0 variables fixed on reduced cost
Cuts at root node changed objective from -3.9366e+07 to -3.9366e+07
Knapsack was tried 1 times and created 0 cuts of which 0 were active after adding rounds of cuts (0.026 seconds)

Result - Stopped on node limit
