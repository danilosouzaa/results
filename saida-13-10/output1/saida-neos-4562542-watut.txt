seconds was changed from 1e+100 to 1200
Continuous objective value is 3743.3 - 188.40 seconds
Cbc0031I 1 added rows had average density of 926
Cbc0013I At root node, 1 cuts changed objective from 3743.3043 to 3746.8583 in 1 passes
Cbc0014I Cut generator 0 (Knapsack) - 3 row cuts average 398.7 elements, 0 column cuts (0 active)  in 11.852 seconds - new frequency is 1
Cbc0003I Exiting on maximum nodes
Cbc0005I Partial search - best objective 1e+50 (best possible 3746.8583), took 16436 iterations and 0 nodes (377.98 seconds)
Cbc0035I Maximum depth 0, 0 variables fixed on reduced cost
Cuts at root node changed objective from 3743.3 to 3746.86
Knapsack was tried 1 times and created 3 cuts of which 0 were active after adding rounds of cuts (11.852 seconds)

Result - Stopped on node limit
