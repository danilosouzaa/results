seconds was changed from 1e+100 to 1200
Continuous objective value is 3.10002e+06 - 0.21 seconds
Cutoff increment increased from 0.0001 to 0.9999
Cbc0031I 6 added rows had average density of 2.6666667
Cbc0013I At root node, 6 cuts changed objective from 3100022 to 3100022 in 1 passes
Cbc0014I Cut generator 0 (Knapsack) - 9 row cuts average 2.7 elements, 0 column cuts (0 active)  in 0.155 seconds - new frequency is 1
Cbc0003I Exiting on maximum nodes
Cbc0005I Partial search - best objective 1e+50 (best possible 3100022), took 20 iterations and 0 nodes (0.61 seconds)
Cbc0035I Maximum depth 0, 0 variables fixed on reduced cost
Cuts at root node changed objective from 3.10002e+06 to 3.10002e+06
Knapsack was tried 1 times and created 9 cuts of which 0 were active after adding rounds of cuts (0.155 seconds)

Result - Stopped on node limit
