Continuous objective value is 380.9 - 3.74 seconds
Cutoff increment increased from 0.0001 to 0.9999
Cbc0031I 21 added rows had average density of 16.857143
Cbc0013I At root node, 89 cuts changed objective from 380.9 to 380.9 in 1 passes
Cbc0014I Cut generator 0 (Knapsack) - 89 row cuts average 20.4 elements, 0 column cuts (0 active)  in 36.552 seconds - new frequency is 1
Cbc0001I Search completed - best objective 1e+50, took 2093 iterations and 0 nodes (49.26 seconds)
Cbc0035I Maximum depth 0, 0 variables fixed on reduced cost
Cuts at root node changed objective from 380.9 to 380.9
Knapsack was tried 1 times and created 89 cuts of which 0 were active after adding rounds of cuts (36.552 seconds)

Result - Problem proven infeasible
