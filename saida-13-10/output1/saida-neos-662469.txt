seconds was changed from 1e+100 to 1200
Continuous objective value is 184341 - 2.03 seconds
Cutoff increment increased from 0.0001 to 0.4999
Cbc0031I 20 added rows had average density of 5
Cbc0013I At root node, 20 cuts changed objective from 184340.63 to 184343.74 in 1 passes
Cbc0014I Cut generator 0 (Knapsack) - 26 row cuts average 5.2 elements, 0 column cuts (0 active)  in 6.164 seconds - new frequency is 1
Cbc0003I Exiting on maximum nodes
Cbc0005I Partial search - best objective 1e+50 (best possible 184343.74), took 402 iterations and 0 nodes (8.90 seconds)
Cbc0035I Maximum depth 0, 0 variables fixed on reduced cost
Cuts at root node changed objective from 184341 to 184344
Knapsack was tried 1 times and created 26 cuts of which 0 were active after adding rounds of cuts (6.164 seconds)

Result - Stopped on node limit
