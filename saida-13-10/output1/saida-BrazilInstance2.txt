seconds was changed from 1e+100 to 1200
Continuous objective value is 3.99994 - 1179.85 seconds
Cbc0045I 1 integer variables out of 18334 objects (16083 integer) have cost of 1 - high priority
Cbc0045I branch on satisfied Y create fake objective Y random cost Y
Cbc0031I 53 added rows had average density of 6.0188679
Cbc0013I At root node, 53 cuts changed objective from 4 to 4 in 1 passes
Cbc0014I Cut generator 0 (Knapsack) - 53 row cuts average 6.0 elements, 0 column cuts (0 active)  in 19.152 seconds - new frequency is 1
Cbc0020I Exiting on maximum time
Cbc0005I Partial search - best objective 1e+50 (best possible 4), took 3743 iterations and 0 nodes (1208.83 seconds)
Cbc0035I Maximum depth 0, 0 variables fixed on reduced cost
Cuts at root node changed objective from 4 to 4
Knapsack was tried 1 times and created 53 cuts of which 0 were active after adding rounds of cuts (19.152 seconds)

Result - Stopped on time limit
