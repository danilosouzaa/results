Continuous objective value is 455.299 - 0.08 seconds
Cbc0013I At root node, 0 cuts changed objective from 455.2988 to 455.2988 in 1 passes
Cbc0014I Cut generator 0 (Knapsack) - 0 row cuts average 0.0 elements, 0 column cuts (0 active)  in 0.009 seconds - new frequency is 1000
Cbc0003I Exiting on maximum nodes
Cbc0005I Partial search - best objective 1e+50 (best possible 455.2988), took 0 iterations and 0 nodes (0.14 seconds)
Cbc0035I Maximum depth 0, 0 variables fixed on reduced cost
Cuts at root node changed objective from 455.299 to 455.299
