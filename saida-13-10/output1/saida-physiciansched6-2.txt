seconds was changed from 1e+100 to 1200
Continuous objective value is 43012.5 - 15.32 seconds
Cbc0031I 1 added rows had average density of 3
Cbc0013I At root node, 1 cuts changed objective from 46419.25 to 46419.25 in 1 passes
Cbc0014I Cut generator 0 (Knapsack) - 10 row cuts average 2.1 elements, 0 column cuts (0 active)  in 43.371 seconds - new frequency is 1
Cbc0003I Exiting on maximum nodes
Cbc0005I Partial search - best objective 1e+50 (best possible 46419.25), took 884 iterations and 0 nodes (98.54 seconds)
Cbc0035I Maximum depth 0, 0 variables fixed on reduced cost
Cuts at root node changed objective from 46419.2 to 46419.2
Knapsack was tried 1 times and created 10 cuts of which 0 were active after adding rounds of cuts (43.371 seconds)

Result - Stopped on node limit
