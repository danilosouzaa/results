Continuous objective value is 0 - 7.38 seconds
Cutoff increment increased from 0.0001 to 0.9999
Cbc0031I 2 added rows had average density of 91.5
Cbc0013I At root node, 2 cuts changed objective from 0 to 0 in 1 passes
Cbc0014I Cut generator 0 (Knapsack) - 2 row cuts average 91.5 elements, 0 column cuts (0 active)  in 47.010 seconds - new frequency is 1
Cbc0003I Exiting on maximum nodes
Cbc0005I Partial search - best objective 1e+50 (best possible 0), took 658 iterations and 0 nodes (79.48 seconds)
Cbc0035I Maximum depth 0, 0 variables fixed on reduced cost
Cuts at root node changed objective from 0 to 0
Knapsack was tried 1 times and created 2 cuts of which 0 were active after adding rounds of cuts (47.010 seconds)

Result - Stopped on node limit
