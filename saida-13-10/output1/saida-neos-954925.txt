Continuous objective value is -237.824 - 26.07 seconds
Cbc0031I 159 added rows had average density of 4.8113208
Cbc0013I At root node, 159 cuts changed objective from -237.8237 to -237.8237 in 1 passes
Cbc0014I Cut generator 0 (Knapsack) - 343 row cuts average 5.2 elements, 0 column cuts (0 active)  in 34.024 seconds - new frequency is 1
Cbc0003I Exiting on maximum nodes
Cbc0005I Partial search - best objective 1e+50 (best possible -237.8237), took 4171 iterations and 0 nodes (82.42 seconds)
Cbc0035I Maximum depth 0, 0 variables fixed on reduced cost
Cuts at root node changed objective from -237.824 to -237.824
Knapsack was tried 1 times and created 343 cuts of which 0 were active after adding rounds of cuts (34.024 seconds)

Result - Stopped on node limit
