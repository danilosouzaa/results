Continuous objective value is -22372.5 - 7.16 seconds
Cutoff increment increased from 0.0001 to 0.9999
Cbc0031I 45 added rows had average density of 6.6222222
Cbc0013I At root node, 45 cuts changed objective from -22372.476 to -22366.852 in 1 passes
Cbc0014I Cut generator 0 (Knapsack) - 260 row cuts average 6.4 elements, 0 column cuts (0 active)  in 44.478 seconds - new frequency is 1
Cbc0003I Exiting on maximum nodes
Cbc0005I Partial search - best objective 1e+50 (best possible -22366.852), took 91 iterations and 0 nodes (54.26 seconds)
Cbc0035I Maximum depth 0, 0 variables fixed on reduced cost
Cuts at root node changed objective from -22372.5 to -22366.9
Knapsack was tried 1 times and created 260 cuts of which 0 were active after adding rounds of cuts (44.478 seconds)

Result - Stopped on node limit
