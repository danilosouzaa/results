Problem neos-1396125 has 1494 rows, 1161 columns and 5511 elements
Coin0008I neos-1396125 read with 0 errors
maxNodes was changed from 2147483647 to 0
passCuts was changed from 20 to 1
Option for cutsOnOff changed from on to off
Option for knapsackCuts changed from off to on
Option for heuristicsOnOff changed from on to off
Option for preprocess changed from sos to off
seconds was changed from 1e+100 to 1200
Continuous objective value is 388.552 - 0.19 seconds
Cbc0031I 2 added rows had average density of 16
Cbc0013I At root node, 2 cuts changed objective from 388.5524 to 388.5524 in 1 passes
Cbc0014I Cut generator 0 (Knapsack) - 3 row cuts average 20.0 elements, 0 column cuts (0 active)  in 0.272 seconds - new frequency is 1
Cbc0003I Exiting on maximum nodes
Cbc0005I Partial search - best objective 1e+50 (best possible 388.5524), took 52 iterations and 0 nodes (0.50 seconds)
Cbc0035I Maximum depth 0, 0 variables fixed on reduced cost
Cuts at root node changed objective from 388.552 to 388.552
Knapsack was tried 1 times and created 3 cuts of which 0 were active after adding rounds of cuts (0.272 seconds)

Result - Stopped on node limit
