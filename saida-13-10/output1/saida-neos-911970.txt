Problem neos-911970 has 107 rows, 888 columns and 3408 elements
Coin0008I neos-911970 read with 0 errors
maxNodes was changed from 2147483647 to 0
passCuts was changed from 20 to 1
Option for cutsOnOff changed from on to off
Option for knapsackCuts changed from off to on
Option for heuristicsOnOff changed from on to off
Option for preprocess changed from sos to off
seconds was changed from 1e+100 to 1200
Continuous objective value is 23.26 - 0.01 seconds
Cbc0031I 16 added rows had average density of 2.1875
Cbc0013I At root node, 16 cuts changed objective from 23.26 to 23.26 in 1 passes
Cbc0014I Cut generator 0 (Knapsack) - 18 row cuts average 2.3 elements, 0 column cuts (0 active)  in 0.104 seconds - new frequency is 1
Cbc0003I Exiting on maximum nodes
Cbc0005I Partial search - best objective 1e+50 (best possible 23.26), took 27 iterations and 0 nodes (0.11 seconds)
Cbc0035I Maximum depth 0, 0 variables fixed on reduced cost
Cuts at root node changed objective from 23.26 to 23.26
Knapsack was tried 1 times and created 18 cuts of which 0 were active after adding rounds of cuts (0.104 seconds)

Result - Stopped on node limit

No feasible solution found
