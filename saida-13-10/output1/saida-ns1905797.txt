Coin0008I ns1905797 read with 0 errors
maxNodes was changed from 2147483647 to 0
passCuts was changed from 20 to 1
Option for cutsOnOff changed from on to off
Option for knapsackCuts changed from off to on
Option for heuristicsOnOff changed from on to off
Option for preprocess changed from sos to off
seconds was changed from 1e+100 to 1200
Continuous objective value is 11.751 - 0.92 seconds
Cbc0031I 1 added rows had average density of 2
Cbc0013I At root node, 1 cuts changed objective from 11.75098 to 11.75098 in 1 passes
Cbc0014I Cut generator 0 (Knapsack) - 1 row cuts average 2.0 elements, 0 column cuts (0 active)  in 0.472 seconds - new frequency is 1
Cbc0003I Exiting on maximum nodes
Cbc0005I Partial search - best objective 1e+50 (best possible 11.75098), took 1 iterations and 0 nodes (1.86 seconds)
Cbc0035I Maximum depth 0, 0 variables fixed on reduced cost
Cuts at root node changed objective from 11.751 to 11.751
Knapsack was tried 1 times and created 1 cuts of which 0 were active after adding rounds of cuts (0.472 seconds)

Result - Stopped on node limit

No feasible solution found
