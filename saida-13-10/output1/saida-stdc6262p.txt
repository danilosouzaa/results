Continuous objective value is -1.39428e+06 - 6.33 seconds
Cutoff increment increased from 0.0001 to 1.2499
Cbc0031I 52 added rows had average density of 4.0384615
Cbc0013I At root node, 52 cuts changed objective from -1394276.6 to -1394109 in 1 passes
Cbc0014I Cut generator 0 (Knapsack) - 56 row cuts average 4.0 elements, 0 column cuts (0 active)  in 31.411 seconds - new frequency is 1
Cbc0003I Exiting on maximum nodes
Cbc0005I Partial search - best objective 1e+50 (best possible -1394109), took 844 iterations and 0 nodes (38.84 seconds)
Cbc0035I Maximum depth 0, 0 variables fixed on reduced cost
Cuts at root node changed objective from -1.39428e+06 to -1.39411e+06
Knapsack was tried 1 times and created 56 cuts of which 0 were active after adding rounds of cuts (31.411 seconds)
