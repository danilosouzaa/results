seconds was changed from 1e+100 to 1200
Continuous objective value is -41.9574 - 0.53 seconds
Cutoff increment increased from 0.0001 to 0.9999
Cbc0031I 2 added rows had average density of 157
Cbc0013I At root node, 2 cuts changed objective from -41.957447 to -41.957447 in 1 passes
Cbc0014I Cut generator 0 (Knapsack) - 2 row cuts average 157.0 elements, 0 column cuts (0 active)  in 2.798 seconds - new frequency is 1
Cbc0003I Exiting on maximum nodes
Cbc0005I Partial search - best objective 1e+50 (best possible -41.957447), took 42 iterations and 0 nodes (3.38 seconds)
Cbc0035I Maximum depth 0, 0 variables fixed on reduced cost
Cuts at root node changed objective from -41.9574 to -41.9574
Knapsack was tried 1 times and created 2 cuts of which 0 were active after adding rounds of cuts (2.798 seconds)

Result - Stopped on node limit
