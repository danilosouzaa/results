Problem chromaticindex128-5 has 8447 rows, 9216 columns and 33780 elements
Coin0008I chromaticindex128-5 read with 0 errors
maxNodes was changed from 2147483647 to 0
passCuts was changed from 20 to 1
Option for cutsOnOff changed from on to off
Option for knapsackCuts changed from off to on
Option for heuristicsOnOff changed from on to off
Option for preprocess changed from sos to off
seconds was changed from 1e+100 to 1200
Continuous objective value is 3 - 3.63 seconds
Cutoff increment increased from 0.0001 to 0.9999
Cbc0045I 4 integer variables out of 9216 objects (9216 integer) have cost of 1 - high priority
Cbc0045I branch on satisfied Y create fake objective Y random cost Y
Cbc0013I At root node, 0 cuts changed objective from 3 to 3 in 1 passes
Cbc0014I Cut generator 0 (Knapsack) - 0 row cuts average 0.0 elements, 0 column cuts (0 active)  in 10.513 seconds - new frequency is 1000
Cbc0003I Exiting on maximum nodes
Cbc0005I Partial search - best objective 1e+50 (best possible 3), took 0 iterations and 0 nodes (14.36 seconds)
Cbc0035I Maximum depth 0, 0 variables fixed on reduced cost
Cuts at root node changed objective from 3 to 3
Knapsack was tried 1 times and created 0 cuts of which 0 were active after adding rounds of cuts (10.513 seconds)

Result - Stopped on node limit

No feasible solution found
