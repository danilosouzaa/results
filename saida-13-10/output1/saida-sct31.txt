Problem sct31 has 3932 rows, 8515 columns and 68453 elements
Coin0008I sct31 read with 0 errors
maxNodes was changed from 2147483647 to 0
passCuts was changed from 20 to 1
Option for cutsOnOff changed from on to off
Option for knapsackCuts changed from off to on
Option for heuristicsOnOff changed from on to off

seconds was changed from 1e+100 to 1200
Continuous objective value is -31.9627 - 1.13 seconds
Cbc0031I 2 added rows had average density of 6
Cbc0013I At root node, 2 cuts changed objective from -31.962662 to -31.962532 in 1 passes
Cbc0014I Cut generator 0 (Knapsack) - 4 row cuts average 6.2 elements, 0 column cuts (0 active)  in 0.904 seconds - new frequency is 1
Cbc0003I Exiting on maximum nodes
Cbc0005I Partial search - best objective 1e+50 (best possible -31.962532), took 32 iterations and 0 nodes (2.18 seconds)
Cbc0035I Maximum depth 0, 0 variables fixed on reduced cost
Cuts at root node changed objective from -31.9627 to -31.9625
Knapsack was tried 1 times and created 4 cuts of which 0 were active after adding rounds of cuts (0.904 seconds)

Result - Stopped on node limit

No feasible solution found
