seconds was changed from 1e+100 to 1200
Continuous objective value is -1099 - 27.67 seconds
Cbc0031I 11 added rows had average density of 9.5454545
Cbc0013I At root node, 11 cuts changed objective from -1099 to -1099 in 1 passes
Cbc0014I Cut generator 0 (Knapsack) - 45 row cuts average 16.8 elements, 0 column cuts (0 active)  in 9.805 seconds - new frequency is 1
Cbc0003I Exiting on maximum nodes
Cbc0005I Partial search - best objective 1e+50 (best possible -1099), took 3403 iterations and 0 nodes (49.88 seconds)
Cbc0035I Maximum depth 0, 0 variables fixed on reduced cost
Cuts at root node changed objective from -1099 to -1099
Knapsack was tried 1 times and created 45 cuts of which 0 were active after adding rounds of cuts (9.805 seconds)

Result - Stopped on node limit

No feasible solution found
