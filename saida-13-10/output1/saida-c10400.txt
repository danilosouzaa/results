seconds was changed from 1e+100 to 1200
Continuous objective value is 5591.1 - 0.03 seconds
Cutoff increment increased from 0.0001 to 0.9999
Cbc0031I 7 added rows had average density of 39.142857
Cbc0013I At root node, 7 cuts changed objective from 5591.1039 to 5591.795 in 1 passes
Cbc0014I Cut generator 0 (Knapsack) - 12 row cuts average 39.8 elements, 0 column cuts (0 active)  in 0.818 seconds - new frequency is 1
Cbc0003I Exiting on maximum nodes
Cbc0005I Partial search - best objective 1e+50 (best possible 5591.795), took 19 iterations and 0 nodes (0.88 seconds)
Cbc0035I Maximum depth 0, 0 variables fixed on reduced cost
Cuts at root node changed objective from 5591.1 to 5591.8
Knapsack was tried 1 times and created 12 cuts of which 0 were active after adding rounds of cuts (0.818 seconds)

Result - Stopped on node limit
