Continuous objective value is 76.5815 - 0.49 seconds
Cbc0013I At root node, 0 cuts changed objective from 76.581466 to 76.581466 in 1 passes
Cbc0014I Cut generator 0 (Knapsack) - 0 row cuts average 0.0 elements, 0 column cuts (0 active)  in 0.103 seconds - new frequency is 1000
Cbc0003I Exiting on maximum nodes
Cbc0005I Partial search - best objective 1e+50 (best possible 76.581466), took 0 iterations and 0 nodes (1.04 seconds)
Cbc0035I Maximum depth 0, 0 variables fixed on reduced cost
Cuts at root node changed objective from 76.5815 to 76.5815
Knapsack was tried 1 times and created 0 cuts of which 0 were active after adding rounds of cuts (0.103 seconds)

Result - Stopped on node limit
