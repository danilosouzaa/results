seconds was changed from 1e+100 to 1200
Continuous objective value is 26.2036 - 0.30 seconds
Cbc0031I 1 added rows had average density of 75
Cbc0013I At root node, 1 cuts changed objective from 26.203596 to 26.266493 in 1 passes
Cbc0014I Cut generator 0 (Knapsack) - 1 row cuts average 75.0 elements, 0 column cuts (0 active)  in 0.331 seconds - new frequency is 1
Cbc0003I Exiting on maximum nodes
Cbc0005I Partial search - best objective 1e+50 (best possible 26.266493), took 29 iterations and 0 nodes (0.79 seconds)
Cbc0035I Maximum depth 0, 0 variables fixed on reduced cost
Cuts at root node changed objective from 26.2036 to 26.2665
Knapsack was tried 1 times and created 1 cuts of which 0 were active after adding rounds of cuts (0.331 seconds)

Result - Stopped on node limit
