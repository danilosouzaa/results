seconds was changed from 1e+100 to 1200
Continuous objective value is 1.38849 - 25.66 seconds
Cutoff increment increased from 0.0001 to 0.9999
Cbc0031I 15 added rows had average density of 7
Cbc0013I At root node, 15 cuts changed objective from 1.3884894 to 1.4224744 in 1 passes
Cbc0014I Cut generator 0 (Knapsack) - 172 row cuts average 11.3 elements, 0 column cuts (0 active)  in 6.367 seconds - new frequency is 1
Cbc0003I Exiting on maximum nodes
Cbc0005I Partial search - best objective 1e+50 (best possible 1.4224744), took 2696 iterations and 0 nodes (34.47 seconds)
Cbc0035I Maximum depth 0, 0 variables fixed on reduced cost
Cuts at root node changed objective from 1.38849 to 1.42247
Knapsack was tried 1 times and created 172 cuts of which 0 were active after adding rounds of cuts (6.367 seconds)
