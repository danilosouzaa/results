seconds was changed from 1e+100 to 1200
Continuous objective value is 2520.57 - 0.00 seconds
Cutoff increment increased from 0.0001 to 0.9999
Cbc0031I 6 added rows had average density of 4.8333333
Cbc0013I At root node, 6 cuts changed objective from 2520.5717 to 2831.3364 in 1 passes
Cbc0014I Cut generator 0 (Knapsack) - 9 row cuts average 6.4 elements, 0 column cuts (0 active)  in 0.001 seconds - new frequency is 1
Cbc0003I Exiting on maximum nodes
Cbc0005I Partial search - best objective 1e+50 (best possible 2831.3364), took 14 iterations and 0 nodes (0.01 seconds)
Cbc0035I Maximum depth 0, 0 variables fixed on reduced cost
Cuts at root node changed objective from 2520.57 to 2831.34
Knapsack was tried 1 times and created 9 cuts of which 0 were active after adding rounds of cuts (0.001 seconds)

Result - Stopped on node limit
