seconds was changed from 1e+100 to 1200
Continuous objective value is -552.5 - 1.29 seconds
Cutoff increment increased from 0.0001 to 4.9999
Cbc0031I 3 added rows had average density of 45.666667
Cbc0013I At root node, 3 cuts changed objective from -552.5 to -552.5 in 1 passes
Cbc0014I Cut generator 0 (Knapsack) - 3 row cuts average 45.7 elements, 0 column cuts (0 active)  in 0.024 seconds - new frequency is 1
Cbc0003I Exiting on maximum nodes
Cbc0005I Partial search - best objective 1e+50 (best possible -552.5), took 141 iterations and 0 nodes (3.54 seconds)
Cbc0035I Maximum depth 0, 0 variables fixed on reduced cost
Cuts at root node changed objective from -552.5 to -552.5
Knapsack was tried 1 times and created 3 cuts of which 0 were active after adding rounds of cuts (0.024 seconds)

Result - Stopped on node limit

No feasible solution found
