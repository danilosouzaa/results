Continuous objective value is 4.94807e+06 - 0.06 seconds
Cbc0031I 19 added rows had average density of 12.210526
Cbc0013I At root node, 19 cuts changed objective from 4948073.5 to 5194891.1 in 1 passes
Cbc0014I Cut generator 0 (Knapsack) - 82 row cuts average 13.3 elements, 0 column cuts (0 active)  in 0.028 seconds - new frequency is 1
Cbc0003I Exiting on maximum nodes
Cbc0005I Partial search - best objective 1e+50 (best possible 5194891.1), took 117 iterations and 0 nodes (0.17 seconds)
