seconds was changed from 1e+100 to 1200
Continuous objective value is 6970 - 5.36 seconds
Cbc0045I 1 integer variables out of 11635 objects (9930 integer) have cost of 1 - high priority
Cbc0045I branch on satisfied N create fake objective N random cost N
Cbc0031I 1 added rows had average density of 4
Cbc0013I At root node, 1 cuts changed objective from 7114.21 to 7120.6385 in 1 passes
Cbc0014I Cut generator 0 (Knapsack) - 1 row cuts average 4.0 elements, 0 column cuts (0 active)  in 0.024 seconds - new frequency is 1
Cbc0003I Exiting on maximum nodes
Cbc0005I Partial search - best objective 1e+50 (best possible 7120.6385), took 290 iterations and 0 nodes (6.30 seconds)
Cbc0035I Maximum depth 0, 0 variables fixed on reduced cost
Cuts at root node changed objective from 7114.21 to 7120.64
Knapsack was tried 1 times and created 1 cuts of which 0 were active after adding rounds of cuts (0.024 seconds)

Result - Stopped on node limit
