seconds was changed from 1e+100 to 1200
Continuous objective value is -548.905 - 1.25 seconds
Cbc0031I 142 added rows had average density of 3.5774648
Cbc0013I At root node, 142 cuts changed objective from -548.90468 to -543.09349 in 1 passes
Cbc0014I Cut generator 0 (Knapsack) - 205 row cuts average 3.6 elements, 0 column cuts (0 active)  in 0.053 seconds - new frequency is 1
Cbc0003I Exiting on maximum nodes
Cbc0005I Partial search - best objective 1e+50 (best possible -543.09349), took 1075 iterations and 0 nodes (2.42 seconds)
Cbc0035I Maximum depth 0, 0 variables fixed on reduced cost
Cuts at root node changed objective from -548.905 to -543.093
Knapsack was tried 1 times and created 205 cuts of which 0 were active after adding rounds of cuts (0.053 seconds)

Result - Stopped on node limit

No feasible solution found
