seconds was changed from 1e+100 to 1200
Continuous objective value is 81.2432 - 23.25 seconds
Cbc0031I 34 added rows had average density of 4.0294118
Cbc0013I At root node, 34 cuts changed objective from 81.243201 to 81.447412 in 1 passes
Cbc0014I Cut generator 0 (Knapsack) - 145 row cuts average 4.2 elements, 0 column cuts (0 active)  in 0.887 seconds - new frequency is 1
Cbc0003I Exiting on maximum nodes
Cbc0005I Partial search - best objective 1e+50 (best possible 81.447412), took 4162 iterations and 0 nodes (34.43 seconds)
Cbc0035I Maximum depth 0, 0 variables fixed on reduced cost
Cuts at root node changed objective from 81.2432 to 81.4474
Knapsack was tried 1 times and created 145 cuts of which 0 were active after adding rounds of cuts (0.887 seconds)

Result - Stopped on node limit
