seconds was changed from 1e+100 to 1200
Continuous objective value is 3758.75 - 1.50 seconds
Cbc0031I 16 added rows had average density of 2.625
Cbc0013I At root node, 16 cuts changed objective from 3758.7532 to 3758.7624 in 1 passes
Cbc0014I Cut generator 0 (Knapsack) - 16 row cuts average 2.6 elements, 0 column cuts (0 active)  in 0.246 seconds - new frequency is 1
Cbc0003I Exiting on maximum nodes
Cbc0005I Partial search - best objective 1e+50 (best possible 3758.7624), took 242 iterations and 0 nodes (3.30 seconds)
Cbc0035I Maximum depth 0, 0 variables fixed on reduced cost
Cuts at root node changed objective from 3758.75 to 3758.76
Knapsack was tried 1 times and created 16 cuts of which 0 were active after adding rounds of cuts (0.246 seconds)

Result - Stopped on node limit
