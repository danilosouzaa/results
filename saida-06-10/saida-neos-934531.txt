seconds was changed from 1e+100 to 1200
Continuous objective value is 2.00007 - 2.26 seconds
Cutoff increment increased from 0.0001 to 0.9999
Cbc0031I 1 added rows had average density of 2
Cbc0013I At root node, 1 cuts changed objective from 2.00007 to 2.5 in 1 passes
Cbc0014I Cut generator 0 (Knapsack) - 2 row cuts average 3.5 elements, 0 column cuts (0 active)  in 0.084 seconds - new frequency is 1
Cbc0003I Exiting on maximum nodes
Cbc0005I Partial search - best objective 1e+50 (best possible 2.5), took 207 iterations and 0 nodes (4.10 seconds)
Cbc0035I Maximum depth 0, 0 variables fixed on reduced cost
Cuts at root node changed objective from 2.00007 to 2.5
Knapsack was tried 1 times and created 2 cuts of which 0 were active after adding rounds of cuts (0.084 seconds)

Result - Stopped on node limit
