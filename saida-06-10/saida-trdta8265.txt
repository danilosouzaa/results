seconds was changed from 1e+100 to 1200
Continuous objective value is -187031 - 2.96 seconds
Cbc0031I 230 added rows had average density of 6.4826087
Cbc0013I At root node, 230 cuts changed objective from -187030.84 to -186625.9 in 1 passes
Cbc0014I Cut generator 0 (Knapsack) - 511 row cuts average 5.1 elements, 0 column cuts (0 active)  in 0.114 seconds - new frequency is 1
Cbc0003I Exiting on maximum nodes
Cbc0005I Partial search - best objective 1e+50 (best possible -186625.9), took 7869 iterations and 0 nodes (10.01 seconds)
Cbc0035I Maximum depth 0, 0 variables fixed on reduced cost
Cuts at root node changed objective from -187031 to -186626
Knapsack was tried 1 times and created 511 cuts of which 0 were active after adding rounds of cuts (0.114 seconds)

Result - Stopped on node limit
