seconds was changed from 1e+100 to 1200
Continuous objective value is 43.4747 - 42.47 seconds
Cbc0031I 2 added rows had average density of 2
Cbc0013I At root node, 2 cuts changed objective from 43.474651 to 43.474651 in 1 passes
Cbc0014I Cut generator 0 (Knapsack) - 2 row cuts average 2.0 elements, 0 column cuts (0 active)  in 0.024 seconds - new frequency is 1
Cbc0003I Exiting on maximum nodes
Cbc0005I Partial search - best objective 1e+50 (best possible 43.474651), took 2 iterations and 0 nodes (43.83 seconds)
Cbc0035I Maximum depth 0, 0 variables fixed on reduced cost
Cuts at root node changed objective from 43.4747 to 43.4747
Knapsack was tried 1 times and created 2 cuts of which 0 were active after adding rounds of cuts (0.024 seconds)

Result - Stopped on node limit
