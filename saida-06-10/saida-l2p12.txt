Problem l2p12 has 21315 rows, 11786 columns and 59629 elements
Coin0008I l2p12 read with 0 errors
maxNodes was changed from 2147483647 to 0
passCuts was changed from 20 to 1
Option for cutsOnOff changed from on to off
Option for knapsackCuts changed from off to on
Option for heuristicsOnOff changed from on to off
Option for preprocess changed from sos to off
seconds was changed from 1e+100 to 1200
Continuous objective value is 2 - 1.21 seconds
Cbc0045I 1 integer variables out of 11496 objects (11066 integer) have cost of 1 - high priority
Cbc0045I branch on satisfied Y create fake objective Y random cost Y
Cbc0031I 5 added rows had average density of 8.8
Cbc0013I At root node, 5 cuts changed objective from 2 to 2 in 1 passes
Cbc0014I Cut generator 0 (Knapsack) - 6 row cuts average 8.7 elements, 0 column cuts (0 active)  in 0.023 seconds - new frequency is 1
Cbc0003I Exiting on maximum nodes
Cbc0005I Partial search - best objective 1e+50 (best possible 2), took 127 iterations and 0 nodes (2.09 seconds)
Cbc0035I Maximum depth 0, 0 variables fixed on reduced cost
Cuts at root node changed objective from 2 to 2
Knapsack was tried 1 times and created 6 cuts of which 0 were active after adding rounds of cuts (0.023 seconds)

Result - Stopped on node limit
