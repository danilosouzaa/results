seconds was changed from 1e+100 to 1200
Continuous objective value is 300.25 - 28.16 seconds
Cutoff increment increased from 0.0001 to 0.9999
Cbc0031I 169 added rows had average density of 2.0295858
Cbc0013I At root node, 169 cuts changed objective from 300.25 to 300.25 in 1 passes
Cbc0014I Cut generator 0 (Knapsack) - 200 row cuts average 2.1 elements, 0 column cuts (0 active)  in 0.172 seconds - new frequency is 1
Cbc0003I Exiting on maximum nodes
Cbc0005I Partial search - best objective 1e+50 (best possible 300.25), took 11300 iterations and 0 nodes (74.95 seconds)
Cbc0035I Maximum depth 0, 0 variables fixed on reduced cost
Cuts at root node changed objective from 300.25 to 300.25
Knapsack was tried 1 times and created 200 cuts of which 0 were active after adding rounds of cuts (0.172 seconds)

Result - Stopped on node limit
