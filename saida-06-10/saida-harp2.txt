seconds was changed from 1e+100 to 1200
Continuous objective value is -7.43533e+07 - 0.02 seconds
Cutoff increment increased from 0.0001 to 0.9999
Cbc0031I 1 added rows had average density of 4
Cbc0013I At root node, 1 cuts changed objective from -74325169 to -74301044 in 1 passes
Cbc0014I Cut generator 0 (Knapsack) - 1 row cuts average 4.0 elements, 0 column cuts (0 active)  in 0.005 seconds - new frequency is 1
Cbc0003I Exiting on maximum nodes
Cbc0005I Partial search - best objective 1e+50 (best possible -74301044), took 6 iterations and 0 nodes (0.05 seconds)
Cbc0035I Maximum depth 0, 0 variables fixed on reduced cost
Cuts at root node changed objective from -7.43252e+07 to -7.4301e+07
Knapsack was tried 1 times and created 1 cuts of which 0 were active after adding rounds of cuts (0.005 seconds)

Result - Stopped on node limit
