seconds was changed from 1e+100 to 1200
Continuous objective value is 10030.5 - 70.47 seconds
Cbc0031I 1439 added rows had average density of 3.8971508
Cbc0013I At root node, 1439 cuts changed objective from 10030.534 to 18802.036 in 1 passes
Cbc0014I Cut generator 0 (Knapsack) - 3665 row cuts average 3.8 elements, 0 column cuts (0 active)  in 0.766 seconds - new frequency is 1
Cbc0003I Exiting on maximum nodes
Cbc0005I Partial search - best objective 1e+50 (best possible 18802.036), took 43209 iterations and 0 nodes (168.04 seconds)
Cbc0035I Maximum depth 0, 0 variables fixed on reduced cost
Cuts at root node changed objective from 10030.5 to 18802
Knapsack was tried 1 times and created 3665 cuts of which 0 were active after adding rounds of cuts (0.766 seconds)

Result - Stopped on node limit
