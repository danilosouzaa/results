Problem ran14x18-disj-8 has 447 rows, 504 columns and 10277 elements
Coin0008I ran14x18-disj-8 read with 0 errors
maxNodes was changed from 2147483647 to 0
passCuts was changed from 20 to 1
Option for cutsOnOff changed from on to off
Option for knapsackCuts changed from off to on
Option for heuristicsOnOff changed from on to off

seconds was changed from 1e+100 to 1200
Continuous objective value is 3444.42 - 0.18 seconds
Cbc0031I 1 added rows had average density of 15
Cbc0013I At root node, 1 cuts changed objective from 3444.4211 to 3444.4378 in 1 passes
Cbc0014I Cut generator 0 (Knapsack) - 1 row cuts average 15.0 elements, 0 column cuts (0 active)  in 0.008 seconds - new frequency is 1
Cbc0003I Exiting on maximum nodes
Cbc0005I Partial search - best objective 1e+50 (best possible 3444.4378), took 7 iterations and 0 nodes (0.26 seconds)
Cbc0035I Maximum depth 0, 0 variables fixed on reduced cost
Cuts at root node changed objective from 3444.42 to 3444.44
Knapsack was tried 1 times and created 1 cuts of which 0 were active after adding rounds of cuts (0.008 seconds)

Result - Stopped on node limit
