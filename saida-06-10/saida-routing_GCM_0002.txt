seconds was changed from 1e+100 to 1200
Continuous objective value is 52976.8 - 2.49 seconds
Cbc0045I 1 integer variables out of 13015 objects (12330 integer) have cost of 1 - high priority
Cbc0045I branch on satisfied N create fake objective N random cost N
Cbc0031I 15 added rows had average density of 23.533333
Cbc0013I At root node, 15 cuts changed objective from 53026.781 to 53026.781 in 1 passes
Cbc0014I Cut generator 0 (Knapsack) - 15 row cuts average 23.5 elements, 0 column cuts (0 active)  in 0.121 seconds - new frequency is 1
Cbc0003I Exiting on maximum nodes
Cbc0005I Partial search - best objective 1e+50 (best possible 53026.781), took 105 iterations and 0 nodes (3.34 seconds)
Cbc0035I Maximum depth 0, 0 variables fixed on reduced cost
Cuts at root node changed objective from 53026.8 to 53026.8
Knapsack was tried 1 times and created 15 cuts of which 0 were active after adding rounds of cuts (0.121 seconds)

Result - Stopped on node limit
