Continuous objective value is -146.941 - 166.50 seconds
Cbc0013I At root node, 0 cuts changed objective from -146.94108 to -146.94108 in 1 passes
Cbc0014I Cut generator 0 (Knapsack) - 0 row cuts average 0.0 elements, 0 column cuts (0 active)  in 0.012 seconds - new frequency is 1000

Cbc0005I Partial search - best objective 1e+50 (best possible -146.94108), took 0 iterations and 0 nodes (167.98 seconds)
Cbc0035I Maximum depth 0, 0 variables fixed on reduced cost
Cuts at root node changed objective from -146.941 to -146.941
Knapsack was tried 1 times and created 0 cuts of which 0 were active after adding rounds of cuts (0.012 seconds)

Result - Stopped on node limit
