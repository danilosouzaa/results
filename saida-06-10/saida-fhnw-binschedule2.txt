seconds was changed from 1e+100 to 1200
Continuous objective value is 1706.89 - 13.06 seconds
Cbc0031I 360 added rows had average density of 10.911111
Cbc0013I At root node, 360 cuts changed objective from 1706.8863 to 1835.5168 in 1 passes
Cbc0014I Cut generator 0 (Knapsack) - 691 row cuts average 7.2 elements, 0 column cuts (0 active)  in 0.080 seconds - new frequency is 1
Cbc0003I Exiting on maximum nodes
Cbc0005I Partial search - best objective 1e+50 (best possible 1835.5168), took 2474 iterations and 0 nodes (15.18 seconds)
Cbc0035I Maximum depth 0, 0 variables fixed on reduced cost
Cuts at root node changed objective from 1706.89 to 1835.52
Knapsack was tried 1 times and created 691 cuts of which 0 were active after adding rounds of cuts (0.080 seconds)

Result - Stopped on node limit
