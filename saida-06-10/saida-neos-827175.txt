Problem neos-827175 has 14187 rows, 32504 columns and 110790 elements
Coin0008I neos-827175 read with 0 errors
maxNodes was changed from 2147483647 to 0
passCuts was changed from 20 to 1
Option for cutsOnOff changed from on to off
Option for knapsackCuts changed from off to on
Option for heuristicsOnOff changed from on to off
Option for preprocess changed from sos to off
seconds was changed from 1e+100 to 1200
Continuous objective value is 112.002 - 2.10 seconds
Cbc0031I 18 added rows had average density of 2
Cbc0013I At root node, 18 cuts changed objective from 112.00152 to 112.00152 in 1 passes
Cbc0014I Cut generator 0 (Knapsack) - 41 row cuts average 2.0 elements, 0 column cuts (0 active)  in 0.075 seconds - new frequency is 1
Cbc0003I Exiting on maximum nodes
Cbc0005I Partial search - best objective 1e+50 (best possible 112.00152), took 2138 iterations and 0 nodes (4.13 seconds)
Cbc0035I Maximum depth 0, 0 variables fixed on reduced cost
Cuts at root node changed objective from 112.002 to 112.002
Knapsack was tried 1 times and created 41 cuts of which 0 were active after adding rounds of cuts (0.075 seconds)

Result - Stopped on node limit
