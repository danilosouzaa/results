seconds was changed from 1e+100 to 1200
Continuous objective value is 1 - 323.20 seconds
Cbc0031I 89 added rows had average density of 4.4044944
Cbc0013I At root node, 89 cuts changed objective from 1 to 1 in 1 passes
Cbc0014I Cut generator 0 (Knapsack) - 112 row cuts average 4.6 elements, 0 column cuts (0 active)  in 3.419 seconds - new frequency is 1
Cbc0003I Exiting on maximum nodes
Cbc0005I Partial search - best objective 1e+50 (best possible 1), took 16052 iterations and 0 nodes (862.89 seconds)
Cbc0035I Maximum depth 0, 0 variables fixed on reduced cost
Cuts at root node changed objective from 1 to 1
Knapsack was tried 1 times and created 112 cuts of which 0 were active after adding rounds of cuts (3.419 seconds)

Result - Stopped on node limit
