seconds was changed from 1e+100 to 1200
Continuous objective value is -29.5 - 111.10 seconds
Cutoff increment increased from 0.0001 to 0.9999
Cbc0031I 40 added rows had average density of 3
Cbc0013I At root node, 40 cuts changed objective from -29.5 to -29.5 in 1 passes
Cbc0014I Cut generator 0 (Knapsack) - 56 row cuts average 3.0 elements, 0 column cuts (0 active)  in 0.315 seconds - new frequency is 1
Cbc0003I Exiting on maximum nodes
Cbc0005I Partial search - best objective 1e+50 (best possible -29.5), took 301 iterations and 0 nodes (113.50 seconds)
Cbc0035I Maximum depth 0, 0 variables fixed on reduced cost
Cuts at root node changed objective from -29.5 to -29.5
Knapsack was tried 1 times and created 56 cuts of which 0 were active after adding rounds of cuts (0.315 seconds)

Result - Stopped on node limit
