Continuous objective value is -1256.94 - 0.50 seconds
Cutoff increment increased from 0.0001 to 0.9999
Cbc0031I 70 added rows had average density of 3.4714286
Cbc0013I At root node, 70 cuts changed objective from -1256.9429 to -1256.9429 in 1 passes
Cbc0014I Cut generator 0 (Knapsack) - 81 row cuts average 3.3 elements, 0 column cuts (0 active)  in 0.038 seconds - new frequency is 1
Cbc0003I Exiting on maximum nodes
Cbc0005I Partial search - best objective 1e+50 (best possible -1256.9429), took 1031 iterations and 0 nodes (1.23 seconds)
Cbc0035I Maximum depth 0, 0 variables fixed on reduced cost
Cuts at root node changed objective from -1256.94 to -1256.94
Knapsack was tried 1 times and created 81 cuts of which 0 were active after adding rounds of cuts (0.038 seconds)

Result - Stopped on node limit
