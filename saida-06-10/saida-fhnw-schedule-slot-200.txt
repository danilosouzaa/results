Cbc0005I Partial search - best objective 1e+50 (best possible -73.826479), took 0 iterations and 0 nodes (78.79 seconds)
Cbc0035I Maximum depth 0, 0 variables fixed on reduced cost
Cuts at root node changed objective from -73.8265 to -73.8265
Knapsack was tried 1 times and created 0 cuts of which 0 were active after adding rounds of cuts (0.107 seconds)

Result - Stopped on node limit
