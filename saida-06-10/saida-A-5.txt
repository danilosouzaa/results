seconds was changed from 1e+100 to 1200
Continuous objective value is 105.061 - 95.51 seconds
Cutoff increment increased from 0.0001 to 0.9999
Cbc0045I 5 integer variables out of 48651 objects (48624 integer) have cost of 1 - high priority
Cbc0045I branch on satisfied N create fake objective N random cost N
Cbc0031I 6 added rows had average density of 13.5
Cbc0013I At root node, 6 cuts changed objective from 105.06105 to 106.0347 in 1 passes
Cbc0014I Cut generator 0 (Knapsack) - 15 row cuts average 9.7 elements, 0 column cuts (0 active)  in 0.014 seconds - new frequency is 1
Cbc0003I Exiting on maximum nodes
Cbc0005I Partial search - best objective 1e+50 (best possible 106.0347), took 1296 iterations and 0 nodes (99.73 seconds)
Cbc0035I Maximum depth 0, 0 variables fixed on reduced cost
Cuts at root node changed objective from 105.061 to 106.035
Knapsack was tried 1 times and created 15 cuts of which 0 were active after adding rounds of cuts (0.014 seconds)

Result - Stopped on node limit
