Continuous objective value is 0 - 4.62 seconds
Cbc0031I 341 added rows had average density of 7.8416422
Cbc0013I At root node, 341 cuts changed objective from 0 to 0 in 1 passes
Cbc0014I Cut generator 0 (Knapsack) - 560 row cuts average 9.7 elements, 0 column cuts (0 active)  in 0.215 seconds - new frequency is 1
Cbc0003I Exiting on maximum nodes
Cbc0005I Partial search - best objective 1e+50 (best possible 0), took 1851 iterations and 0 nodes (7.09 seconds)
Cbc0035I Maximum depth 0, 0 variables fixed on reduced cost
Cuts at root node changed objective from 0 to 0
Knapsack was tried 1 times and created 560 cuts of which 0 were active after adding rounds of cuts (0.215 seconds)

Result - Stopped on node limit
