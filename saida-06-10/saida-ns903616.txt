seconds was changed from 1e+100 to 1200
Continuous objective value is 14.7501 - 6.14 seconds
Cbc0045I 22 integer variables out of 21582 objects (16211 integer) have cost of 1 - high priority
Cbc0045I branch on satisfied N create fake objective Y random cost Y
Cbc0013I At root node, 0 cuts changed objective from 14.750147 to 14.750147 in 1 passes
Cbc0014I Cut generator 0 (Knapsack) - 0 row cuts average 0.0 elements, 0 column cuts (0 active)  in 0.052 seconds - new frequency is 1000
Cbc0003I Exiting on maximum nodes
Cbc0005I Partial search - best objective 1e+50 (best possible 14.750147), took 0 iterations and 0 nodes (6.41 seconds)
Cbc0035I Maximum depth 0, 0 variables fixed on reduced cost
Cuts at root node changed objective from 14.7501 to 14.7501
Knapsack was tried 1 times and created 0 cuts of which 0 were active after adding rounds of cuts (0.052 seconds)

Result - Stopped on node limit
