Option for cutsOnOff changed from on to off
Option for knapsackCuts changed from off to on
Option for heuristicsOnOff changed from on to off
Option for preprocess changed from sos to off
seconds was changed from 1e+100 to 1200
Continuous objective value is -120 - 0.39 seconds
Cutoff increment increased from 0.0001 to 0.9999
Cbc0031I 284 added rows had average density of 2
Cbc0013I At root node, 284 cuts changed objective from -120 to -120 in 1 passes
Cbc0014I Cut generator 0 (Knapsack) - 405 row cuts average 2.0 elements, 0 column cuts (0 active)  in 0.045 seconds - new frequency is 1
Cbc0003I Exiting on maximum nodes
Cbc0005I Partial search - best objective 1e+50 (best possible -120), took 852 iterations and 0 nodes (0.64 seconds)
Cbc0035I Maximum depth 0, 0 variables fixed on reduced cost
Cuts at root node changed objective from -120 to -120
Knapsack was tried 1 times and created 405 cuts of which 0 were active after adding rounds of cuts (0.045 seconds)

Result - Stopped on node limit

No feasible solution found
