Continuous objective value is -175 - 1.14 seconds
Cutoff increment increased from 0.0001 to 0.9999
Cbc0031I 71 added rows had average density of 6.2112676
Cbc0013I At root node, 71 cuts changed objective from -175 to -175 in 1 passes
Cbc0014I Cut generator 0 (Knapsack) - 171 row cuts average 4.9 elements, 0 column cuts (0 active)  in 0.035 seconds - new frequency is 1
Cbc0003I Exiting on maximum nodes
Cbc0005I Partial search - best objective 1e+50 (best possible -175), took 239 iterations and 0 nodes (1.32 seconds)
Cbc0035I Maximum depth 0, 0 variables fixed on reduced cost
Cuts at root node changed objective from -175 to -175
Knapsack was tried 1 times and created 171 cuts of which 0 were active after adding rounds of cuts (0.035 seconds)

Result - Stopped on node limit
