seconds was changed from 1e+100 to 1200
Continuous objective value is 7500 - 28.39 seconds
Cbc0031I 899 added rows had average density of 2.2447164
Cbc0013I At root node, 899 cuts changed objective from 8100 to 8100 in 1 passes
Cbc0014I Cut generator 0 (Knapsack) - 1350 row cuts average 2.3 elements, 0 column cuts (0 active)  in 0.450 seconds - new frequency is 1
Cbc0003I Exiting on maximum nodes
Cbc0005I Partial search - best objective 1e+50 (best possible 8100), took 16747 iterations and 0 nodes (267.80 seconds)
Cbc0035I Maximum depth 0, 0 variables fixed on reduced cost
Cuts at root node changed objective from 8100 to 8100
Knapsack was tried 1 times and created 1350 cuts of which 0 were active after adding rounds of cuts (0.450 seconds)

Result - Stopped on node limit
