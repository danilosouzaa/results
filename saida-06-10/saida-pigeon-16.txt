Problem pigeon-16 has 2353 rows, 1072 columns and 21104 elements
Coin0008I pigeon-16 read with 0 errors
maxNodes was changed from 2147483647 to 0
passCuts was changed from 20 to 1
Option for cutsOnOff changed from on to off
Option for knapsackCuts changed from off to on
Option for heuristicsOnOff changed from on to off
Option for preprocess changed from sos to off
seconds was changed from 1e+100 to 1200
Continuous objective value is -16000 - 0.04 seconds
Cbc0045I 16 integer variables out of 928 objects (880 integer) have cost of -1000 - high priority
Cbc0045I branch on satisfied N create fake objective Y random cost Y
Cbc0031I 16 added rows had average density of 3
Cbc0013I At root node, 16 cuts changed objective from -16000 to -16000 in 1 passes
Cbc0014I Cut generator 0 (Knapsack) - 22 row cuts average 3.0 elements, 0 column cuts (0 active)  in 0.020 seconds - new frequency is 1
Cbc0003I Exiting on maximum nodes
Cbc0005I Partial search - best objective 1e+50 (best possible -16000), took 23 iterations and 0 nodes (0.11 seconds)
Cbc0035I Maximum depth 0, 0 variables fixed on reduced cost
Cuts at root node changed objective from -16000 to -16000
Knapsack was tried 1 times and created 22 cuts of which 0 were active after adding rounds of cuts (0.020 seconds)

Result - Stopped on node limit
