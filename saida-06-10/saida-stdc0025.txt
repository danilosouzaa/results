Continuous objective value is -1.74307e+06 - 1.90 seconds
Cutoff increment increased from 0.0001 to 0.9999
Cbc0031I 234 added rows had average density of 4.3504274
Cbc0013I At root node, 234 cuts changed objective from -1743072.6 to -1738096 in 1 passes
Cbc0014I Cut generator 0 (Knapsack) - 268 row cuts average 4.2 elements, 0 column cuts (0 active)  in 0.104 seconds - new frequency is 1
Cbc0003I Exiting on maximum nodes
Cbc0005I Partial search - best objective 1e+50 (best possible -1738096), took 1001 iterations and 0 nodes (2.82 seconds)
