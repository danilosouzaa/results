seconds was changed from 1e+100 to 1200
Continuous objective value is 6637.19 - 0.04 seconds
Cbc0031I 8 added rows had average density of 11
Cbc0013I At root node, 8 cuts changed objective from 6637.188 to 6645.9567 in 1 passes
Cbc0014I Cut generator 0 (Knapsack) - 19 row cuts average 11.8 elements, 0 column cuts (0 active)  in 0.005 seconds - new frequency is 1
Cbc0003I Exiting on maximum nodes
Cbc0005I Partial search - best objective 1e+50 (best possible 6645.9567), took 47 iterations and 0 nodes (0.08 seconds)
Cbc0035I Maximum depth 0, 0 variables fixed on reduced cost
Cuts at root node changed objective from 6637.19 to 6645.96
Knapsack was tried 1 times and created 19 cuts of which 0 were active after adding rounds of cuts (0.005 seconds)

Result - Stopped on node limit
