seconds was changed from 1e+100 to 1200
Continuous objective value is 5891.23 - 0.93 seconds
Cbc0031I 10 added rows had average density of 27.6
Cbc0013I At root node, 10 cuts changed objective from 5891.2266 to 5906.9924 in 1 passes
Cbc0014I Cut generator 0 (Knapsack) - 17 row cuts average 26.0 elements, 0 column cuts (0 active)  in 0.018 seconds - new frequency is 1
Cbc0003I Exiting on maximum nodes
Cbc0005I Partial search - best objective 1e+50 (best possible 5906.9924), took 38 iterations and 0 nodes (1.21 seconds)
Cbc0035I Maximum depth 0, 0 variables fixed on reduced cost
Cuts at root node changed objective from 5891.23 to 5906.99
Knapsack was tried 1 times and created 17 cuts of which 0 were active after adding rounds of cuts (0.018 seconds)

Result - Stopped on node limit

No feasible solution found
