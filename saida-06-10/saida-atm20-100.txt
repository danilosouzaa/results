seconds was changed from 1e+100 to 1200
Continuous objective value is 2.14173e+06 - 0.26 seconds
Cbc0031I 41 added rows had average density of 9.2682927
Cbc0013I At root node, 41 cuts changed objective from 2141734.7 to 2141778.9 in 1 passes
Cbc0014I Cut generator 0 (Knapsack) - 61 row cuts average 9.0 elements, 0 column cuts (0 active)  in 0.170 seconds - new frequency is 1
Cbc0003I Exiting on maximum nodes
Cbc0005I Partial search - best objective 1e+50 (best possible 2141778.9), took 50 iterations and 0 nodes (0.57 seconds)
Cbc0035I Maximum depth 0, 0 variables fixed on reduced cost
Cuts at root node changed objective from 2.14173e+06 to 2.14178e+06
Knapsack was tried 1 times and created 61 cuts of which 0 were active after adding rounds of cuts (0.170 seconds)

Result - Stopped on node limit
