seconds was changed from 1e+100 to 1200
Continuous objective value is 43012.5 - 14.89 seconds
Cbc0031I 782 added rows had average density of 2.5179028
Cbc0013I At root node, 782 cuts changed objective from 46419.25 to 46420.235 in 1 passes
Cbc0014I Cut generator 0 (Knapsack) - 1338 row cuts average 2.4 elements, 0 column cuts (0 active)  in 0.421 seconds - new frequency is 1
Cbc0003I Exiting on maximum nodes
Cbc0005I Partial search - best objective 1e+50 (best possible 46420.235), took 6146 iterations and 0 nodes (71.84 seconds)
Cbc0035I Maximum depth 0, 0 variables fixed on reduced cost
Cuts at root node changed objective from 46419.2 to 46420.2
Knapsack was tried 1 times and created 1338 cuts of which 0 were active after adding rounds of cuts (0.421 seconds)

Result - Stopped on node limit
