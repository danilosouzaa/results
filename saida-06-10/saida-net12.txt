seconds was changed from 1e+100 to 1200
Continuous objective value is 17.2495 - 0.65 seconds
Cutoff increment increased from 0.0001 to 0.9999
Cbc0031I 28 added rows had average density of 2
Cbc0013I At root node, 28 cuts changed objective from 17.249479 to 26.643218 in 1 passes
Cbc0014I Cut generator 0 (Knapsack) - 41 row cuts average 2.0 elements, 0 column cuts (0 active)  in 0.092 seconds - new frequency is 1
Cbc0003I Exiting on maximum nodes
Cbc0005I Partial search - best objective 1e+50 (best possible 26.643218), took 1955 iterations and 0 nodes (2.23 seconds)
Cbc0035I Maximum depth 0, 0 variables fixed on reduced cost
Cuts at root node changed objective from 17.2495 to 26.6432
Knapsack was tried 1 times and created 41 cuts of which 0 were active after adding rounds of cuts (0.092 seconds)

Result - Stopped on node limit
