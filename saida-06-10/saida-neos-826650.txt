Problem neos-826650 has 2414 rows, 5912 columns and 20440 elements
Coin0008I neos-826650 read with 0 errors
maxNodes was changed from 2147483647 to 0
passCuts was changed from 20 to 1
Option for cutsOnOff changed from on to off
Option for knapsackCuts changed from off to on
Option for heuristicsOnOff changed from on to off
Option for preprocess changed from sos to off
seconds was changed from 1e+100 to 1200
Continuous objective value is 28 - 0.83 seconds
Cbc0045I 32 integer variables out of 5792 objects (5792 integer) have cost of 1 - high priority
Cbc0045I branch on satisfied N create fake objective Y random cost Y
Cbc0031I 16 added rows had average density of 4.8125
Cbc0013I At root node, 16 cuts changed objective from 28 to 28 in 1 passes
Cbc0014I Cut generator 0 (Knapsack) - 32 row cuts average 4.0 elements, 0 column cuts (0 active)  in 0.025 seconds - new frequency is 1
Cbc0003I Exiting on maximum nodes
Cbc0005I Partial search - best objective 1e+50 (best possible 28), took 287 iterations and 0 nodes (1.08 seconds)
Cbc0035I Maximum depth 0, 0 variables fixed on reduced cost
Cuts at root node changed objective from 28 to 28
Knapsack was tried 1 times and created 32 cuts of which 0 were active after adding rounds of cuts (0.025 seconds)

Result - Stopped on node limit

No feasible solution found
