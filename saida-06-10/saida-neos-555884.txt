seconds was changed from 1e+100 to 1200
Continuous objective value is 1.02612e+06 - 0.22 seconds
Cutoff increment increased from 0.0001 to 99.9999
Cbc0031I 125 added rows had average density of 2.32
Cbc0013I At root node, 125 cuts changed objective from 1026121.8 to 1026121.8 in 1 passes
Cbc0014I Cut generator 0 (Knapsack) - 221 row cuts average 5.3 elements, 0 column cuts (0 active)  in 0.036 seconds - new frequency is 1
Cbc0003I Exiting on maximum nodes
Cbc0005I Partial search - best objective 1e+50 (best possible 1026121.8), took 800 iterations and 0 nodes (0.42 seconds)
Cbc0035I Maximum depth 0, 0 variables fixed on reduced cost
Cuts at root node changed objective from 1.02612e+06 to 1.02612e+06
