seconds was changed from 1e+100 to 1200
Continuous objective value is 72.6641 - 1.96 seconds
Cbc0031I 12 added rows had average density of 6.1666667
Cbc0013I At root node, 12 cuts changed objective from 72.664116 to 76.116582 in 1 passes
Cbc0014I Cut generator 0 (Knapsack) - 18 row cuts average 6.3 elements, 0 column cuts (0 active)  in 0.217 seconds - new frequency is 1
Cbc0003I Exiting on maximum nodes
Cbc0005I Partial search - best objective 1e+50 (best possible 76.116582), took 249 iterations and 0 nodes (4.35 seconds)
Cbc0035I Maximum depth 0, 0 variables fixed on reduced cost
Cuts at root node changed objective from 72.6641 to 76.1166
Knapsack was tried 1 times and created 18 cuts of which 0 were active after adding rounds of cuts (0.217 seconds)

Result - Stopped on node limit
