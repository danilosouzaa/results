seconds was changed from 1e+100 to 1200
Continuous objective value is 1.9521e+07 - 41.42 seconds
Cbc0031I 54 added rows had average density of 4.5555556
Cbc0013I At root node, 54 cuts changed objective from 19520966 to 19605828 in 1 passes
Cbc0014I Cut generator 0 (Knapsack) - 208 row cuts average 4.3 elements, 0 column cuts (0 active)  in 0.248 seconds - new frequency is 1
Cbc0003I Exiting on maximum nodes
Cbc0005I Partial search - best objective 1e+50 (best possible 19605828), took 7399 iterations and 0 nodes (54.84 seconds)
Cbc0035I Maximum depth 0, 0 variables fixed on reduced cost
Cuts at root node changed objective from 1.9521e+07 to 1.96058e+07
Knapsack was tried 1 times and created 208 cuts of which 0 were active after adding rounds of cuts (0.248 seconds)

Result - Stopped on node limit
