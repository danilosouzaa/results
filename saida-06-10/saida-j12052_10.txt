seconds was changed from 1e+100 to 1200
Continuous objective value is 11.3428 - 108.66 seconds
Cutoff increment increased from 0.0001 to 0.9999
Cbc0031I 5 added rows had average density of 14
Cbc0013I At root node, 5 cuts changed objective from 11.342799 to 11.503076 in 1 passes
Cbc0014I Cut generator 0 (Knapsack) - 7 row cuts average 14.0 elements, 0 column cuts (0 active)  in 0.005 seconds - new frequency is 1
Cbc0003I Exiting on maximum nodes
Cbc0005I Partial search - best objective 1e+50 (best possible 11.503076), took 1564 iterations and 0 nodes (112.21 seconds)
Cbc0035I Maximum depth 0, 0 variables fixed on reduced cost
Cuts at root node changed objective from 11.3428 to 11.5031
Knapsack was tried 1 times and created 7 cuts of which 0 were active after adding rounds of cuts (0.005 seconds)

Result - Stopped on node limit
