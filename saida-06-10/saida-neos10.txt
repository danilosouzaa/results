seconds was changed from 1e+100 to 1200
Continuous objective value is -1246.16 - 8.34 seconds
Cutoff increment increased from 0.0001 to 0.9999
Cbc0031I 41 added rows had average density of 2.8536585
Cbc0013I At root node, 41 cuts changed objective from -1246.1649 to -1246.0623 in 1 passes
Cbc0014I Cut generator 0 (Knapsack) - 41 row cuts average 2.9 elements, 0 column cuts (0 active)  in 0.282 seconds - new frequency is 1
Cbc0003I Exiting on maximum nodes
Cbc0005I Partial search - best objective 1e+50 (best possible -1246.0623), took 55 iterations and 0 nodes (9.19 seconds)
Cbc0035I Maximum depth 0, 0 variables fixed on reduced cost
Cuts at root node changed objective from -1246.16 to -1246.06
Knapsack was tried 1 times and created 41 cuts of which 0 were active after adding rounds of cuts (0.282 seconds)

Result - Stopped on node limit
