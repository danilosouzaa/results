Problem blp-ir98 has 486 rows, 6097 columns and 79152 elements
Coin0008I blp-ir98 read with 0 errors
maxNodes was changed from 2147483647 to 0
passCuts was changed from 20 to 1
Option for cutsOnOff changed from on to off
Option for knapsackCuts changed from off to on
Option for heuristicsOnOff changed from on to off
Option for preprocess changed from sos to off
seconds was changed from 1e+100 to 1200
Continuous objective value is 2235.2 - 0.30 seconds
Cbc0031I 1 added rows had average density of 6
Cbc0013I At root node, 1 cuts changed objective from 2235.2023 to 2240.4988 in 1 passes
Cbc0014I Cut generator 0 (Knapsack) - 1 row cuts average 6.0 elements, 0 column cuts (0 active)  in 0.005 seconds - new frequency is 1
Cbc0003I Exiting on maximum nodes
Cbc0005I Partial search - best objective 1e+50 (best possible 2240.4988), took 1 iterations and 0 nodes (0.41 seconds)
Cbc0035I Maximum depth 0, 0 variables fixed on reduced cost
Cuts at root node changed objective from 2235.2 to 2240.5
Knapsack was tried 1 times and created 1 cuts of which 0 were active after adding rounds of cuts (0.005 seconds)

Result - Stopped on node limit
