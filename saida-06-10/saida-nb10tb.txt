seconds was changed from 1e+100 to 1200
Continuous objective value is 1.29861e+10 - 76.22 seconds
Cbc0031I 2 added rows had average density of 5.5
Cbc0013I At root node, 2 cuts changed objective from 1.2986061e+10 to 1.2986061e+10 in 1 passes
Cbc0014I Cut generator 0 (Knapsack) - 2 row cuts average 5.5 elements, 0 column cuts (0 active)  in 0.834 seconds - new frequency is 1
Cbc0003I Exiting on maximum nodes
Cbc0005I Partial search - best objective 1e+50 (best possible 1.2986061e+10), took 245 iterations and 0 nodes (82.34 seconds)
Cbc0035I Maximum depth 0, 0 variables fixed on reduced cost
Cuts at root node changed objective from 1.29861e+10 to 1.29861e+10
Knapsack was tried 1 times and created 2 cuts of which 0 were active after adding rounds of cuts (0.834 seconds)

Result - Stopped on node limit
