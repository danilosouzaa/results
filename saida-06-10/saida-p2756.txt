seconds was changed from 1e+100 to 1200
Continuous objective value is 2688.75 - 0.02 seconds
Cutoff increment increased from 0.0001 to 0.9999
Cbc0031I 34 added rows had average density of 7.1764706
Cbc0013I At root node, 34 cuts changed objective from 2698.9472 to 2701.5 in 1 passes
Cbc0014I Cut generator 0 (Knapsack) - 39 row cuts average 7.2 elements, 0 column cuts (0 active)  in 0.008 seconds - new frequency is 1
Cbc0003I Exiting on maximum nodes
Cbc0005I Partial search - best objective 1e+50 (best possible 2701.5), took 44 iterations and 0 nodes (0.06 seconds)
Cbc0035I Maximum depth 0, 0 variables fixed on reduced cost
Cuts at root node changed objective from 2698.95 to 2701.5
Knapsack was tried 1 times and created 39 cuts of which 0 were active after adding rounds of cuts (0.008 seconds)

Result - Stopped on node limit
