Cutoff increment increased from 0.0001 to 0.9999
Cbc0031I 3691 added rows had average density of 2
Cbc0013I At root node, 3691 cuts changed objective from -22372.476 to -21664.159 in 1 passes
Cbc0014I Cut generator 0 (Knapsack) - 3708 row cuts average 2.0 elements, 0 column cuts (0 active)  in 0.786 seconds - new frequency is 1
Cbc0003I Exiting on maximum nodes
Cbc0005I Partial search - best objective 1e+50 (best possible -21664.159), took 4026 iterations and 0 nodes (14.41 seconds)
Cbc0035I Maximum depth 0, 0 variables fixed on reduced cost
Cuts at root node changed objective from -22372.5 to -21664.2
Knapsack was tried 1 times and created 3708 cuts of which 0 were active after adding rounds of cuts (0.786 seconds)

Result - Stopped on node limit
