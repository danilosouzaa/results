seconds was changed from 1e+100 to 1200
Continuous objective value is -2.2581e+07 - 0.00 seconds
Cbc0031I 3 added rows had average density of 30
Cbc0013I At root node, 3 cuts changed objective from -22581000 to -20447700 in 1 passes
Cbc0014I Cut generator 0 (Knapsack) - 3 row cuts average 30.0 elements, 0 column cuts (0 active)  in 0.003 seconds - new frequency is 1
Cbc0003I Exiting on maximum nodes
Cbc0005I Partial search - best objective 1e+50 (best possible -20447700), took 57 iterations and 0 nodes (0.02 seconds)
Cbc0035I Maximum depth 0, 0 variables fixed on reduced cost
Cuts at root node changed objective from -2.2581e+07 to -2.04477e+07
Knapsack was tried 1 times and created 3 cuts of which 0 were active after adding rounds of cuts (0.003 seconds)

Result - Stopped on node limit
