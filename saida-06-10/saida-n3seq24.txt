Problem n3seq24 has 6044 rows, 119856 columns and 3232340 elements
Coin0008I n3seq24 read with 0 errors
maxNodes was changed from 2147483647 to 0
passCuts was changed from 20 to 1
Option for cutsOnOff changed from on to off
Option for knapsackCuts changed from off to on
Option for heuristicsOnOff changed from on to off
Option for preprocess changed from sos to off
seconds was changed from 1e+100 to 1200
Continuous objective value is 52000 - 57.87 seconds
Cutoff increment increased from 0.0001 to 200
Cbc0013I At root node, 0 cuts changed objective from 52000 to 52000 in 1 passes
Cbc0014I Cut generator 0 (Knapsack) - 0 row cuts average 0.0 elements, 0 column cuts (0 active)  in 0.119 seconds - new frequency is 1000
Cbc0003I Exiting on maximum nodes
Cbc0005I Partial search - best objective 1e+50 (best possible 52000), took 0 iterations and 0 nodes (60.25 seconds)
Cbc0035I Maximum depth 0, 0 variables fixed on reduced cost
Cuts at root node changed objective from 52000 to 52000
Knapsack was tried 1 times and created 0 cuts of which 0 were active after adding rounds of cuts (0.119 seconds)

Result - Stopped on node limit
