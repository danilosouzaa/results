Continuous objective value is 1897.14 - 53.43 seconds
Cbc0031I 1440 added rows had average density of 4.9902778
Cbc0013I At root node, 1440 cuts changed objective from 1897.1405 to 1899.9699 in 1 passes
Cbc0014I Cut generator 0 (Knapsack) - 1454 row cuts average 5.0 elements, 0 column cuts (0 active)  in 0.430 seconds - new frequency is 1
Cbc0003I Exiting on maximum nodes
Cbc0005I Partial search - best objective 1e+50 (best possible 1899.9699), took 2147 iterations and 0 nodes (55.70 seconds)
Cbc0035I Maximum depth 0, 0 variables fixed on reduced cost
Cuts at root node changed objective from 1897.14 to 1899.97
Knapsack was tried 1 times and created 1454 cuts of which 0 were active after adding rounds of cuts (0.430 seconds)
