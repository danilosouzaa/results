seconds was changed from 1e+100 to 1200
Continuous objective value is 30 - 85.43 seconds
Cbc0031I 1 added rows had average density of 25
Cbc0013I At root node, 1 cuts changed objective from 30 to 33.896386 in 1 passes
Cbc0014I Cut generator 0 (Knapsack) - 3 row cuts average 22.3 elements, 0 column cuts (0 active)  in 0.189 seconds - new frequency is 1
Cbc0003I Exiting on maximum nodes
Cbc0005I Partial search - best objective 1e+50 (best possible 33.896386), took 2445 iterations and 0 nodes (121.82 seconds)
Cbc0035I Maximum depth 0, 0 variables fixed on reduced cost
Cuts at root node changed objective from 30 to 33.8964
Knapsack was tried 1 times and created 3 cuts of which 0 were active after adding rounds of cuts (0.189 seconds)

Result - Stopped on node limit

No feasible solution found
