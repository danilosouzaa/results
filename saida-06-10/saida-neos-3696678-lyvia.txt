Continuous objective value is 4.42266 - 0.15 seconds
Cutoff increment increased from 0.0001 to 0.04995
Cbc0031I 14 added rows had average density of 2
Cbc0013I At root node, 14 cuts changed objective from 83.75 to 83.75 in 1 passes
Cbc0014I Cut generator 0 (Knapsack) - 14 row cuts average 2.0 elements, 0 column cuts (0 active)  in 0.016 seconds - new frequency is 1
Cbc0003I Exiting on maximum nodes
Cbc0005I Partial search - best objective 1e+50 (best possible 83.75), took 26 iterations and 0 nodes (0.55 seconds)
Cbc0035I Maximum depth 0, 0 variables fixed on reduced cost
Cuts at root node changed objective from 83.75 to 83.75
Knapsack was tried 1 times and created 14 cuts of which 0 were active after adding rounds of cuts (0.016 seconds)

Result - Stopped on node limit
