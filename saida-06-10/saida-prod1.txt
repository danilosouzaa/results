Problem prod1 has 208 rows, 250 columns and 5350 elements
Coin0008I prod1 read with 0 errors
maxNodes was changed from 2147483647 to 0
passCuts was changed from 20 to 1
Option for cutsOnOff changed from on to off
Option for knapsackCuts changed from off to on
Option for heuristicsOnOff changed from on to off
Option for preprocess changed from sos to off
seconds was changed from 1e+100 to 1200
Continuous objective value is -100 - 0.01 seconds
Cbc0031I 7 added rows had average density of 35
Cbc0013I At root node, 7 cuts changed objective from -100 to -100 in 1 passes
Cbc0014I Cut generator 0 (Knapsack) - 58 row cuts average 34.5 elements, 0 column cuts (0 active)  in 0.016 seconds - new frequency is 1
Cbc0003I Exiting on maximum nodes
Cbc0005I Partial search - best objective 1e+50 (best possible -100), took 26 iterations and 0 nodes (0.04 seconds)
Cbc0035I Maximum depth 0, 0 variables fixed on reduced cost
Cuts at root node changed objective from -100 to -100
Knapsack was tried 1 times and created 58 cuts of which 0 were active after adding rounds of cuts (0.016 seconds)

Result - Stopped on node limit

No feasible solution found
