seconds was changed from 1e+100 to 1200
Continuous objective value is 285.156 - 0.20 seconds
Cbc0031I 174 added rows had average density of 2.2758621
Cbc0013I At root node, 174 cuts changed objective from 1540.0872 to 1709.138 in 1 passes
Cbc0014I Cut generator 0 (Knapsack) - 197 row cuts average 2.3 elements, 0 column cuts (0 active)  in 0.034 seconds - new frequency is 1
Cbc0003I Exiting on maximum nodes
Cbc0005I Partial search - best objective 1e+50 (best possible 1709.138), took 477 iterations and 0 nodes (0.88 seconds)
Cbc0035I Maximum depth 0, 0 variables fixed on reduced cost
Cuts at root node changed objective from 1540.09 to 1709.14
Knapsack was tried 1 times and created 197 cuts of which 0 were active after adding rounds of cuts (0.034 seconds)

Result - Stopped on node limit
