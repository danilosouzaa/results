Problem ci-s4 has 26159 rows, 745 columns and 129124 elements
Coin0008I ci-s4 read with 0 errors
maxNodes was changed from 2147483647 to 0
passCuts was changed from 20 to 1
Option for cutsOnOff changed from on to off
Option for knapsackCuts changed from off to on
Option for heuristicsOnOff changed from on to off
Option for preprocess changed from sos to off
seconds was changed from 1e+100 to 1200
Continuous objective value is 4.96381 - 0.15 seconds
Cbc0031I 1 added rows had average density of 3
Cbc0013I At root node, 1 cuts changed objective from 4.9638091 to 4.9638091 in 1 passes
Cbc0014I Cut generator 0 (Knapsack) - 1 row cuts average 3.0 elements, 0 column cuts (0 active)  in 0.005 seconds - new frequency is 1
Cbc0003I Exiting on maximum nodes
Cbc0005I Partial search - best objective 1e+50 (best possible 4.9638091), took 1 iterations and 0 nodes (0.45 seconds)
Cbc0035I Maximum depth 0, 0 variables fixed on reduced cost
Cuts at root node changed objective from 4.96381 to 4.96381
Knapsack was tried 1 times and created 1 cuts of which 0 were active after adding rounds of cuts (0.005 seconds)

Result - Stopped on node limit
