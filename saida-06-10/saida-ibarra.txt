seconds was changed from 1e+100 to 1200
Continuous objective value is 390.612 - 0.01 seconds
Cbc0031I 1 added rows had average density of 36
Cbc0013I At root node, 1 cuts changed objective from 390.61154 to 410.10621 in 1 passes
Cbc0014I Cut generator 0 (Knapsack) - 6 row cuts average 41.0 elements, 0 column cuts (0 active)  in 0.008 seconds - new frequency is 1
Cbc0003I Exiting on maximum nodes
Cbc0005I Partial search - best objective 1e+50 (best possible 410.10621), took 10 iterations and 0 nodes (0.03 seconds)
Cbc0035I Maximum depth 0, 0 variables fixed on reduced cost
Cuts at root node changed objective from 390.612 to 410.106
Knapsack was tried 1 times and created 6 cuts of which 0 were active after adding rounds of cuts (0.008 seconds)

Result - Stopped on node limit
