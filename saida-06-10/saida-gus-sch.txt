seconds was changed from 1e+100 to 1200
Continuous objective value is -1205.73 - 0.08 seconds
Cbc0031I 23 added rows had average density of 27.478261
Cbc0013I At root node, 23 cuts changed objective from -1200.5833 to -1200.5833 in 1 passes
Cbc0014I Cut generator 0 (Knapsack) - 49 row cuts average 31.7 elements, 0 column cuts (0 active)  in 0.034 seconds - new frequency is 1
Cbc0003I Exiting on maximum nodes
Cbc0005I Partial search - best objective 1e+50 (best possible -1200.5833), took 43 iterations and 0 nodes (0.22 seconds)
Cbc0035I Maximum depth 0, 0 variables fixed on reduced cost
Cuts at root node changed objective from -1200.58 to -1200.58
Knapsack was tried 1 times and created 49 cuts of which 0 were active after adding rounds of cuts (0.034 seconds)

Result - Stopped on node limit
