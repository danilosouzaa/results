Cbc0013I At root node, 0 cuts changed objective from 188.25 to 188.25 in 1 passes
Cbc0014I Cut generator 0 (Knapsack) - 0 row cuts average 0.0 elements, 0 column cuts (0 active)  in 0.239 seconds - new frequency is 1000
Cbc0003I Exiting on maximum nodes
Cbc0005I Partial search - best objective 1e+50 (best possible 188.25), took 0 iterations and 0 nodes (163.03 seconds)
Cbc0035I Maximum depth 0, 0 variables fixed on reduced cost
