Continuous objective value is 403.846 - 2.71 seconds
Cbc0013I At root node, 0 cuts changed objective from 403.84647 to 403.84647 in 1 passes
Cbc0014I Cut generator 0 (Knapsack) - 0 row cuts average 0.0 elements, 0 column cuts (0 active)  in 0.011 seconds - new frequency is 1000
Cbc0003I Exiting on maximum nodes
Cbc0005I Partial search - best objective 1e+50 (best possible 403.84647), took 0 iterations and 0 nodes (2.78 seconds)
Cbc0035I Maximum depth 0, 0 variables fixed on reduced cost
Cuts at root node changed objective from 403.846 to 403.846
Knapsack was tried 1 times and created 0 cuts of which 0 were active after adding rounds of cuts (0.011 seconds)

Result - Stopped on node limit
