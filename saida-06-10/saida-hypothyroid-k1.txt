seconds was changed from 1e+100 to 1200
Continuous objective value is -2902.85 - 18.66 seconds
Cutoff increment increased from 0.0001 to 0.9999
Cbc0045I 1 integer variables out of 2602 objects (2599 integer) have cost of -1 - high priority
Cbc0045I branch on satisfied N create fake objective N random cost N
Cbc0031I 1 added rows had average density of 45
Cbc0013I At root node, 1 cuts changed objective from -2902.8526 to -2902.8526 in 1 passes
Cbc0014I Cut generator 0 (Knapsack) - 2416 row cuts average 4.7 elements, 0 column cuts (0 active)  in 0.908 seconds - new frequency is 1
Cbc0003I Exiting on maximum nodes
Cbc0005I Partial search - best objective 1e+50 (best possible -2902.8526), took 4 iterations and 0 nodes (24.29 seconds)
Cbc0035I Maximum depth 0, 0 variables fixed on reduced cost
Cuts at root node changed objective from -2902.85 to -2902.85
Knapsack was tried 1 times and created 2416 cuts of which 0 were active after adding rounds of cuts (0.908 seconds)

Result - Stopped on node limit
