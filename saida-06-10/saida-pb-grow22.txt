Continuous objective value is -449681 - 2.93 seconds
Cutoff increment increased from 0.0001 to 0.9999
Cbc0031I 62 added rows had average density of 4.483871
Cbc0013I At root node, 62 cuts changed objective from -449681.2 to -449672.14 in 1 passes
Cbc0014I Cut generator 0 (Knapsack) - 62 row cuts average 4.5 elements, 0 column cuts (0 active)  in 0.012 seconds - new frequency is 1
Cbc0003I Exiting on maximum nodes
Cbc0005I Partial search - best objective 1e+50 (best possible -449672.14), took 312 iterations and 0 nodes (3.31 seconds)
Cbc0035I Maximum depth 0, 0 variables fixed on reduced cost
Cuts at root node changed objective from -449681 to -449672
Knapsack was tried 1 times and created 62 cuts of which 0 were active after adding rounds of cuts (0.012 seconds)

Result - Stopped on node limit
