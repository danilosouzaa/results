Continuous objective value is -8.87165e+08 - 0.29 seconds
Cbc0013I At root node, 0 cuts changed objective from -8.8716532e+08 to -8.8716532e+08 in 1 passes
Cbc0014I Cut generator 0 (Knapsack) - 0 row cuts average 0.0 elements, 0 column cuts (0 active)  in 0.008 seconds - new frequency is 1000
Cbc0003I Exiting on maximum nodes
Cbc0005I Partial search - best objective 1e+50 (best possible -8.8716532e+08), took 0 iterations and 0 nodes (0.34 seconds)
