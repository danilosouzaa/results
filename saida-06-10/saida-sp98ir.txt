seconds was changed from 1e+100 to 1200
Continuous objective value is 2.16663e+08 - 0.27 seconds
Cbc0031I 3 added rows had average density of 26
Cbc0013I At root node, 3 cuts changed objective from 2.1666344e+08 to 2.1667421e+08 in 1 passes
Cbc0014I Cut generator 0 (Knapsack) - 16 row cuts average 28.2 elements, 0 column cuts (0 active)  in 0.007 seconds - new frequency is 1
Cbc0003I Exiting on maximum nodes
Cbc0005I Partial search - best objective 1e+50 (best possible 2.1667421e+08), took 48 iterations and 0 nodes (0.38 seconds)
Cbc0035I Maximum depth 0, 0 variables fixed on reduced cost
Cuts at root node changed objective from 2.16663e+08 to 2.16674e+08
Knapsack was tried 1 times and created 16 cuts of which 0 were active after adding rounds of cuts (0.007 seconds)

Result - Stopped on node limit
