seconds was changed from 1e+100 to 1200
Continuous objective value is 234 - 1.37 seconds
Cbc0013I At root node, 0 cuts changed objective from 234 to 234 in 1 passes
Cbc0014I Cut generator 0 (Knapsack) - 0 row cuts average 0.0 elements, 0 column cuts (0 active)  in 0.022 seconds - new frequency is 1000
Cbc0003I Exiting on maximum nodes
Cbc0005I Partial search - best objective 1e+50 (best possible 234), took 0 iterations and 0 nodes (1.45 seconds)
Cbc0035I Maximum depth 0, 0 variables fixed on reduced cost
Cuts at root node changed objective from 234 to 234
Knapsack was tried 1 times and created 0 cuts of which 0 were active after adding rounds of cuts (0.022 seconds)

Result - Stopped on node limit
