seconds was changed from 1e+100 to 1200
Continuous objective value is 1 - 7.43 seconds
Cbc0045I 37 integer variables out of 4552 objects (4312 integer) have cost of 1 - high priority
Cbc0045I branch on satisfied N create fake objective Y random cost Y
Cbc0031I 27 added rows had average density of 2
Cbc0013I At root node, 27 cuts changed objective from 1 to 1 in 1 passes
Cbc0014I Cut generator 0 (Knapsack) - 44 row cuts average 2.0 elements, 0 column cuts (0 active)  in 0.043 seconds - new frequency is 1
Cbc0003I Exiting on maximum nodes
Cbc0005I Partial search - best objective 1e+50 (best possible 1), took 1239 iterations and 0 nodes (12.32 seconds)
Cbc0035I Maximum depth 0, 0 variables fixed on reduced cost
Cuts at root node changed objective from 1 to 1
Knapsack was tried 1 times and created 44 cuts of which 0 were active after adding rounds of cuts (0.043 seconds)

Result - Stopped on node limit
