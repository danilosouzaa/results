Continuous objective value is -1.39428e+06 - 6.30 seconds
Cutoff increment increased from 0.0001 to 1.2499
Cbc0031I 48 added rows had average density of 9.25
Cbc0013I At root node, 48 cuts changed objective from -1394276.6 to -1393817.9 in 1 passes
Cbc0014I Cut generator 0 (Knapsack) - 49 row cuts average 9.3 elements, 0 column cuts (0 active)  in 0.091 seconds - new frequency is 1
Cbc0003I Exiting on maximum nodes
Cbc0005I Partial search - best objective 1e+50 (best possible -1393817.9), took 539 iterations and 0 nodes (7.21 seconds)
Cbc0035I Maximum depth 0, 0 variables fixed on reduced cost
Cuts at root node changed objective from -1.39428e+06 to -1.39382e+06
Knapsack was tried 1 times and created 49 cuts of which 0 were active after adding rounds of cuts (0.091 seconds)

Result - Stopped on node limit
