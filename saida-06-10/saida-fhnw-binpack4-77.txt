Continuous objective value is 0 - 0.23 seconds
Cbc0045I No integer variables out of 3816 objects (3418 integer) have costs
Cbc0045I branch on satisfied N create fake objective Y random cost Y
Cbc0031I 44 added rows had average density of 2.2272727
Cbc0013I At root node, 44 cuts changed objective from 0 to 0 in 1 passes
Cbc0014I Cut generator 0 (Knapsack) - 850 row cuts average 2.5 elements, 0 column cuts (0 active)  in 0.076 seconds - new frequency is 1
Cbc0003I Exiting on maximum nodes
Cbc0005I Partial search - best objective 1e+50 (best possible 0), took 1160 iterations and 0 nodes (0.60 seconds)
Cbc0035I Maximum depth 0, 0 variables fixed on reduced cost
Cuts at root node changed objective from 0 to 0
Knapsack was tried 1 times and created 850 cuts of which 0 were active after adding rounds of cuts (0.076 seconds)

Result - Stopped on node limit
