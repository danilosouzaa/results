Continuous objective value is 137.069 - 2.72 seconds
Cbc0013I At root node, 0 cuts changed objective from 137.06917 to 137.06917 in 1 passes
Cbc0014I Cut generator 0 (Knapsack) - 0 row cuts average 0.0 elements, 0 column cuts (0 active)  in 0.055 seconds - new frequency is 1000

Cbc0005I Partial search - best objective 1e+50 (best possible 137.06917), took 0 iterations and 0 nodes (3.00 seconds)
Cbc0035I Maximum depth 0, 0 variables fixed on reduced cost
Cuts at root node changed objective from 137.069 to 137.069
Knapsack was tried 1 times and created 0 cuts of which 0 were active after adding rounds of cuts (0.055 seconds)

Result - Stopped on node limit
