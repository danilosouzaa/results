seconds was changed from 1e+100 to 1200
Continuous objective value is 7277.99 - 0.19 seconds
Cbc0031I 2 added rows had average density of 4
Cbc0013I At root node, 2 cuts changed objective from 7277.987 to 7277.987 in 1 passes
Cbc0014I Cut generator 0 (Knapsack) - 3 row cuts average 5.0 elements, 0 column cuts (0 active)  in 0.007 seconds - new frequency is 1
Cbc0003I Exiting on maximum nodes
Cbc0005I Partial search - best objective 1e+50 (best possible 7277.987), took 43 iterations and 0 nodes (0.27 seconds)
Cbc0035I Maximum depth 0, 0 variables fixed on reduced cost
Cuts at root node changed objective from 7277.99 to 7277.99
Knapsack was tried 1 times and created 3 cuts of which 0 were active after adding rounds of cuts (0.007 seconds)

Result - Stopped on node limit
