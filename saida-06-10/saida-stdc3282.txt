Continuous objective value is -3.50522e+06 - 4.56 seconds
Cutoff increment increased from 0.0001 to 0.9999
Cbc0031I 431 added rows had average density of 2.3155452
Cbc0013I At root node, 431 cuts changed objective from -3505224.7 to -3345856.5 in 1 passes
Cbc0014I Cut generator 0 (Knapsack) - 553 row cuts average 2.3 elements, 0 column cuts (0 active)  in 0.242 seconds - new frequency is 1
Cbc0003I Exiting on maximum nodes
Cbc0005I Partial search - best objective 1e+50 (best possible -3345856.5), took 2886 iterations and 0 nodes (9.04 seconds)
Cbc0035I Maximum depth 0, 0 variables fixed on reduced cost
Cuts at root node changed objective from -3.50522e+06 to -3.34586e+06
Knapsack was tried 1 times and created 553 cuts of which 0 were active after adding rounds of cuts (0.242 seconds)
