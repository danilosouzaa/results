seconds was changed from 1e+100 to 1200
Continuous objective value is 315.255 - 0.01 seconds
Cutoff increment increased from 0.0001 to 0.9999
Cbc0031I 43 added rows had average density of 5.5581395
Cbc0013I At root node, 43 cuts changed objective from 429.6829 to 1997.2209 in 1 passes
Cbc0014I Cut generator 0 (Knapsack) - 68 row cuts average 6.0 elements, 0 column cuts (0 active)  in 0.005 seconds - new frequency is 1
Cbc0003I Exiting on maximum nodes
Cbc0005I Partial search - best objective 1e+50 (best possible 1997.2209), took 107 iterations and 0 nodes (0.02 seconds)
Cbc0035I Maximum depth 0, 0 variables fixed on reduced cost
Cuts at root node changed objective from 429.683 to 1997.22
Knapsack was tried 1 times and created 68 cuts of which 0 were active after adding rounds of cuts (0.005 seconds)

Result - Stopped on node limit
