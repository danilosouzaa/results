seconds was changed from 1e+100 to 1200
Continuous objective value is 7.1653e+07 - 0.08 seconds
Cbc0031I 5 added rows had average density of 4.6
Cbc0013I At root node, 5 cuts changed objective from 71652994 to 71805999 in 1 passes
Cbc0014I Cut generator 0 (Knapsack) - 8 row cuts average 5.5 elements, 0 column cuts (0 active)  in 0.008 seconds - new frequency is 1
Cbc0003I Exiting on maximum nodes
Cbc0005I Partial search - best objective 1e+50 (best possible 71805999), took 98 iterations and 0 nodes (0.15 seconds)
Cbc0035I Maximum depth 0, 0 variables fixed on reduced cost
Cuts at root node changed objective from 7.1653e+07 to 7.1806e+07
Knapsack was tried 1 times and created 8 cuts of which 0 were active after adding rounds of cuts (0.008 seconds)

Result - Stopped on node limit
