seconds was changed from 1e+100 to 1200
Continuous objective value is -321641 - 39.14 seconds
Cbc0031I 52 added rows had average density of 14.134615
Cbc0013I At root node, 52 cuts changed objective from -321641.36 to -320486.51 in 1 passes
Cbc0014I Cut generator 0 (Knapsack) - 142 row cuts average 17.0 elements, 0 column cuts (0 active)  in 0.187 seconds - new frequency is 1
Cbc0003I Exiting on maximum nodes
Cbc0005I Partial search - best objective 1e+50 (best possible -320486.51), took 1585 iterations and 0 nodes (45.72 seconds)
Cbc0035I Maximum depth 0, 0 variables fixed on reduced cost
Cuts at root node changed objective from -321641 to -320487
Knapsack was tried 1 times and created 142 cuts of which 0 were active after adding rounds of cuts (0.187 seconds)

Result - Stopped on node limit
