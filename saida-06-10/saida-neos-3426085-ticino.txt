seconds was changed from 1e+100 to 1200
Continuous objective value is 221.781 - 0.27 seconds
Cutoff increment increased from 0.0001 to 0.9999
Cbc0031I 19 added rows had average density of 2.4210526
Cbc0013I At root node, 19 cuts changed objective from 221.7806 to 221.7806 in 1 passes
Cbc0014I Cut generator 0 (Knapsack) - 26 row cuts average 2.3 elements, 0 column cuts (0 active)  in 0.003 seconds - new frequency is 1
Cbc0003I Exiting on maximum nodes
Cbc0005I Partial search - best objective 1e+50 (best possible 221.7806), took 69 iterations and 0 nodes (0.31 seconds)
Cbc0035I Maximum depth 0, 0 variables fixed on reduced cost
Cuts at root node changed objective from 221.781 to 221.781
Knapsack was tried 1 times and created 26 cuts of which 0 were active after adding rounds of cuts (0.003 seconds)

Result - Stopped on node limit
