Cbc0031I 117 added rows had average density of 7.3162393
Cbc0013I At root node, 117 cuts changed objective from 225364.88 to 225469.77 in 1 passes
Cbc0014I Cut generator 0 (Knapsack) - 314 row cuts average 6.1 elements, 0 column cuts (0 active)  in 0.127 seconds - new frequency is 1
Cbc0003I Exiting on maximum nodes
Cbc0005I Partial search - best objective 1e+50 (best possible 225469.77), took 4205 iterations and 0 nodes (12.89 seconds)
Cbc0035I Maximum depth 0, 0 variables fixed on reduced cost
Cuts at root node changed objective from 225365 to 225470
Knapsack was tried 1 times and created 314 cuts of which 0 were active after adding rounds of cuts (0.127 seconds)

Result - Stopped on node limit
