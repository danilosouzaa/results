Problem co-100 has 2187 rows, 48417 columns and 1995817 elements
Coin0008I co-100 read with 0 errors
maxNodes was changed from 2147483647 to 0
passCuts was changed from 20 to 1
Option for cutsOnOff changed from on to off
Option for knapsackCuts changed from off to on
Option for heuristicsOnOff changed from on to off
Option for preprocess changed from sos to off
seconds was changed from 1e+100 to 1200
Continuous objective value is 917102 - 2.28 seconds
Cbc0031I 20 added rows had average density of 2
Cbc0013I At root node, 20 cuts changed objective from 917102.21 to 917146.4 in 1 passes
Cbc0014I Cut generator 0 (Knapsack) - 20 row cuts average 2.0 elements, 0 column cuts (0 active)  in 0.026 seconds - new frequency is 1
Cbc0003I Exiting on maximum nodes
Cbc0005I Partial search - best objective 1e+50 (best possible 917146.4), took 25 iterations and 0 nodes (3.92 seconds)
Cbc0035I Maximum depth 0, 0 variables fixed on reduced cost
Cuts at root node changed objective from 917102 to 917146
Knapsack was tried 1 times and created 20 cuts of which 0 were active after adding rounds of cuts (0.026 seconds)

Result - Stopped on node limit

No feasible solution found
