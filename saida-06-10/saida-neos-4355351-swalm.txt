seconds was changed from 1e+100 to 1200
Continuous objective value is 9.26187 - 4.25 seconds
Cbc0031I 3 added rows had average density of 2
Cbc0013I At root node, 3 cuts changed objective from 9.2618675 to 9.2618675 in 1 passes
Cbc0014I Cut generator 0 (Knapsack) - 3 row cuts average 2.0 elements, 0 column cuts (0 active)  in 0.257 seconds - new frequency is 1
Cbc0003I Exiting on maximum nodes
Cbc0005I Partial search - best objective 1e+50 (best possible 9.2618675), took 8 iterations and 0 nodes (5.07 seconds)
Cbc0035I Maximum depth 0, 0 variables fixed on reduced cost
Cuts at root node changed objective from 9.26187 to 9.26187
Knapsack was tried 1 times and created 3 cuts of which 0 were active after adding rounds of cuts (0.257 seconds)

Result - Stopped on node limit
