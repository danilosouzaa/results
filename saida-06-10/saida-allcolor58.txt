Problem allcolor58 has 197154 rows, 84376 columns and 515184 elements
Coin0008I allcolor58 read with 0 errors
maxNodes was changed from 2147483647 to 0
passCuts was changed from 20 to 1
Option for cutsOnOff changed from on to off
Option for knapsackCuts changed from off to on
Option for heuristicsOnOff changed from on to off
Option for preprocess changed from sos to off
seconds was changed from 1e+100 to 1200
Continuous objective value is 42 - 208.72 seconds
Cbc0031I 8 added rows had average density of 3
Cbc0013I At root node, 8 cuts changed objective from 42 to 42 in 1 passes
Cbc0014I Cut generator 0 (Knapsack) - 176 row cuts average 3.0 elements, 0 column cuts (0 active)  in 0.604 seconds - new frequency is 1
Cbc0003I Exiting on maximum nodes
Cbc0005I Partial search - best objective 1e+50 (best possible 42), took 4408 iterations and 0 nodes (655.94 seconds)
Cbc0035I Maximum depth 0, 0 variables fixed on reduced cost
Cuts at root node changed objective from 42 to 42
Knapsack was tried 1 times and created 176 cuts of which 0 were active after adding rounds of cuts (0.604 seconds)

Result - Stopped on node limit

No feasible solution found
