seconds was changed from 1e+100 to 1200
Continuous objective value is 8316.01 - 0.33 seconds
Cbc0031I 69 added rows had average density of 3.3188406
Cbc0013I At root node, 69 cuts changed objective from 8321.1132 to 8324.7056 in 1 passes
Cbc0014I Cut generator 0 (Knapsack) - 107 row cuts average 3.1 elements, 0 column cuts (0 active)  in 0.018 seconds - new frequency is 1
Cbc0003I Exiting on maximum nodes
Cbc0005I Partial search - best objective 1e+50 (best possible 8324.7056), took 131 iterations and 0 nodes (0.63 seconds)
Cbc0035I Maximum depth 0, 0 variables fixed on reduced cost
Cuts at root node changed objective from 8320.44 to 8324.71
Knapsack was tried 1 times and created 107 cuts of which 0 were active after adding rounds of cuts (0.018 seconds)

Result - Stopped on node limit
