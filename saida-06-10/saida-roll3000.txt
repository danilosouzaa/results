seconds was changed from 1e+100 to 1200
Continuous objective value is 11097.1 - 0.19 seconds
Cbc0031I 51 added rows had average density of 2.5490196
Cbc0013I At root node, 51 cuts changed objective from 11097.128 to 11098.83 in 1 passes
Cbc0014I Cut generator 0 (Knapsack) - 82 row cuts average 2.4 elements, 0 column cuts (0 active)  in 0.025 seconds - new frequency is 1
Cbc0003I Exiting on maximum nodes
Cbc0005I Partial search - best objective 1e+50 (best possible 11098.83), took 103 iterations and 0 nodes (0.29 seconds)
Cbc0035I Maximum depth 0, 0 variables fixed on reduced cost
Cuts at root node changed objective from 11097.1 to 11098.8
Knapsack was tried 1 times and created 82 cuts of which 0 were active after adding rounds of cuts (0.025 seconds)

Result - Stopped on node limit

No feasible solution found
