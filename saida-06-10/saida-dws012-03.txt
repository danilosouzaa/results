seconds was changed from 1e+100 to 1200
Continuous objective value is 1469.6 - 0.60 seconds
Cbc0031I 66 added rows had average density of 11.954545
Cbc0013I At root node, 66 cuts changed objective from 2170.1754 to 2183.5275 in 1 passes
Cbc0014I Cut generator 0 (Knapsack) - 66 row cuts average 12.0 elements, 0 column cuts (0 active)  in 0.269 seconds - new frequency is 1
Cbc0003I Exiting on maximum nodes
Cbc0005I Partial search - best objective 1e+50 (best possible 2183.5275), took 299 iterations and 0 nodes (1.71 seconds)
Cbc0035I Maximum depth 0, 0 variables fixed on reduced cost
Cuts at root node changed objective from 2170.18 to 2183.53
Knapsack was tried 1 times and created 66 cuts of which 0 were active after adding rounds of cuts (0.269 seconds)

Result - Stopped on node limit
