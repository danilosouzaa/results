Cbc0045I No integer variables out of 48950 objects (44144 integer) have costs
Cbc0045I branch on satisfied N create fake objective Y random cost Y
Cbc0031I 4554 added rows had average density of 2.0180061
Cbc0013I At root node, 4554 cuts changed objective from 0 to 0 in 1 passes
Cbc0014I Cut generator 0 (Knapsack) - 19900 row cuts average 2.1 elements, 0 column cuts (0 active)  in 26.685 seconds - new frequency is 1
Cbc0003I Exiting on maximum nodes
Cbc0005I Partial search - best objective 1e+50 (best possible 0), took 82428 iterations and 0 nodes (818.94 seconds)
Cbc0035I Maximum depth 0, 0 variables fixed on reduced cost
Cuts at root node changed objective from 0 to 0
Knapsack was tried 1 times and created 19900 cuts of which 0 were active after adding rounds of cuts (26.685 seconds)
