seconds was changed from 1e+100 to 1200
Continuous objective value is 687.138 - 0.06 seconds
Cbc0031I 1 added rows had average density of 17
Cbc0013I At root node, 1 cuts changed objective from 687.14582 to 687.14582 in 1 passes
Cbc0014I Cut generator 0 (Knapsack) - 1 row cuts average 17.0 elements, 0 column cuts (0 active)  in 0.004 seconds - new frequency is 1
Cbc0003I Exiting on maximum nodes
Cbc0005I Partial search - best objective 1e+50 (best possible 687.14582), took 2 iterations and 0 nodes (0.12 seconds)
Cbc0035I Maximum depth 0, 0 variables fixed on reduced cost
Cuts at root node changed objective from 687.146 to 687.146
Knapsack was tried 1 times and created 1 cuts of which 0 were active after adding rounds of cuts (0.004 seconds)

Result - Stopped on node limit
