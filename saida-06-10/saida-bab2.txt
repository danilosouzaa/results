seconds was changed from 1e+100 to 1200
Continuous objective value is -432166 - 98.75 seconds
Cbc0031I 35 added rows had average density of 12.228571
Cbc0013I At root node, 35 cuts changed objective from -406658.18 to -406340.78 in 1 passes
Cbc0014I Cut generator 0 (Knapsack) - 84 row cuts average 16.3 elements, 0 column cuts (0 active)  in 0.162 seconds - new frequency is 1
Cbc0003I Exiting on maximum nodes
Cbc0005I Partial search - best objective 1e+50 (best possible -406340.78), took 1254 iterations and 0 nodes (116.56 seconds)
Cbc0035I Maximum depth 0, 0 variables fixed on reduced cost
Cuts at root node changed objective from -406658 to -406341
Knapsack was tried 1 times and created 84 cuts of which 0 were active after adding rounds of cuts (0.162 seconds)

Result - Stopped on node limit
