seconds was changed from 1e+100 to 1200
Continuous objective value is -751 - 0.50 seconds
Cutoff increment increased from 0.0001 to 0.9999
Cbc0031I 91 added rows had average density of 5.5824176
Cbc0013I At root node, 91 cuts changed objective from -751 to -751 in 1 passes
Cbc0014I Cut generator 0 (Knapsack) - 139 row cuts average 7.0 elements, 0 column cuts (0 active)  in 0.051 seconds - new frequency is 1
Cbc0003I Exiting on maximum nodes
Cbc0005I Partial search - best objective 1e+50 (best possible -751), took 975 iterations and 0 nodes (1.22 seconds)
Cbc0035I Maximum depth 0, 0 variables fixed on reduced cost
Cuts at root node changed objective from -751 to -751
Knapsack was tried 1 times and created 139 cuts of which 0 were active after adding rounds of cuts (0.051 seconds)

Result - Stopped on node limit
