Cbc0031I 101 added rows had average density of 2.7326733
Cbc0013I At root node, 101 cuts changed objective from 76.5673 to 76.5673 in 1 passes
Cbc0014I Cut generator 0 (Knapsack) - 158 row cuts average 2.6 elements, 0 column cuts (0 active)  in 0.860 seconds - new frequency is 1
Cbc0003I Exiting on maximum nodes
Cbc0005I Partial search - best objective 1e+50 (best possible 76.5673), took 1151 iterations and 0 nodes (120.30 seconds)
