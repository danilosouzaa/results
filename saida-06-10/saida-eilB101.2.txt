Continuous objective value is 1066.59 - 2.83 seconds
Cbc0013I At root node, 0 cuts changed objective from 1066.5866 to 1066.5866 in 1 passes
Cbc0014I Cut generator 0 (Knapsack) - 0 row cuts average 0.0 elements, 0 column cuts (0 active)  in 0.009 seconds - new frequency is 1000
Cbc0003I Exiting on maximum nodes
Cbc0005I Partial search - best objective 1e+50 (best possible 1066.5866), took 0 iterations and 0 nodes (3.30 seconds)
Cbc0035I Maximum depth 0, 0 variables fixed on reduced cost
Cuts at root node changed objective from 1066.59 to 1066.59
Knapsack was tried 1 times and created 0 cuts of which 0 were active after adding rounds of cuts (0.009 seconds)

Result - Stopped on node limit
