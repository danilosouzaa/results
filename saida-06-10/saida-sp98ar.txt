Continuous objective value is 5.21034e+08 - 2.08 seconds
Cbc0031I 18 added rows had average density of 20.444444
Cbc0013I At root node, 18 cuts changed objective from 5.2103372e+08 to 5.2189573e+08 in 1 passes
Cbc0014I Cut generator 0 (Knapsack) - 31 row cuts average 21.4 elements, 0 column cuts (0 active)  in 0.038 seconds - new frequency is 1
Cbc0003I Exiting on maximum nodes
Cbc0005I Partial search - best objective 1e+50 (best possible 5.2189573e+08), took 360 iterations and 0 nodes (2.77 seconds)
Cbc0035I Maximum depth 0, 0 variables fixed on reduced cost
Cuts at root node changed objective from 5.21034e+08 to 5.21896e+08
Knapsack was tried 1 times and created 31 cuts of which 0 were active after adding rounds of cuts (0.038 seconds)

Result - Stopped on node limit
