seconds was changed from 1e+100 to 1200
Continuous objective value is 5180 - 13.21 seconds
Cbc0031I 679 added rows had average density of 2.3505155
Cbc0013I At root node, 679 cuts changed objective from 5580 to 5580 in 1 passes
Cbc0014I Cut generator 0 (Knapsack) - 996 row cuts average 2.3 elements, 0 column cuts (0 active)  in 0.105 seconds - new frequency is 1
Cbc0003I Exiting on maximum nodes
Cbc0005I Partial search - best objective 1e+50 (best possible 5580), took 5747 iterations and 0 nodes (42.25 seconds)
Cbc0035I Maximum depth 0, 0 variables fixed on reduced cost
Cuts at root node changed objective from 5580 to 5580
Knapsack was tried 1 times and created 996 cuts of which 0 were active after adding rounds of cuts (0.105 seconds)

Result - Stopped on node limit
