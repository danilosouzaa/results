Problem Inst1.lp has 1187 rows, 1163 columns and 5923 elements
Coin0008I Inst1.lp read with 0 errors
maxNodes was changed from 2147483647 to 0
passCuts was changed from 20 to 1
Option for cutsOnOff changed from on to off
Option for knapsackCuts changed from off to on
Option for heuristicsOnOff changed from on to off
Option for preprocess changed from sos to off
seconds was changed from 1e+100 to 1200
Continuous objective value is 189 - 0.11 seconds
Cutoff increment increased from 0.0001 to 0.9999
Cbc0031I 7 added rows had average density of 12.428571
Cbc0013I At root node, 7 cuts changed objective from 189 to 189 in 1 passes
Cbc0014I Cut generator 0 (Knapsack) - 14 row cuts average 10.8 elements, 0 column cuts (0 active)  in 0.009 seconds - new frequency is 1
Cbc0003I Exiting on maximum nodes
Cbc0005I Partial search - best objective 1e+50 (best possible 189), took 270 iterations and 0 nodes (0.20 seconds)
Cbc0035I Maximum depth 0, 0 variables fixed on reduced cost
Cuts at root node changed objective from 189 to 189
Knapsack was tried 1 times and created 14 cuts of which 0 were active after adding rounds of cuts (0.009 seconds)

Result - Stopped on node limit
