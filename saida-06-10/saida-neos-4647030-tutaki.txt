seconds was changed from 1e+100 to 1200
Continuous objective value is 26911.6 - 9.47 seconds
Cbc0031I 4 added rows had average density of 4.25
Cbc0013I At root node, 4 cuts changed objective from 26911.642 to 26911.642 in 1 passes
Cbc0014I Cut generator 0 (Knapsack) - 4 row cuts average 4.2 elements, 0 column cuts (0 active)  in 0.074 seconds - new frequency is 1
Cbc0003I Exiting on maximum nodes
Cbc0005I Partial search - best objective 1e+50 (best possible 26911.642), took 10 iterations and 0 nodes (14.53 seconds)
Cbc0035I Maximum depth 0, 0 variables fixed on reduced cost
Cuts at root node changed objective from 26911.6 to 26911.6
Knapsack was tried 1 times and created 4 cuts of which 0 were active after adding rounds of cuts (0.074 seconds)

Result - Stopped on node limit
