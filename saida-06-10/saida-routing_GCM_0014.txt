seconds was changed from 1e+100 to 1200
Continuous objective value is 12125.5 - 5.16 seconds
Cbc0045I 1 integer variables out of 16333 objects (15157 integer) have cost of 1 - high priority
Cbc0045I branch on satisfied N create fake objective N random cost N
Cbc0031I 4 added rows had average density of 12.25
Cbc0013I At root node, 4 cuts changed objective from 12225.487 to 12225.487 in 1 passes
Cbc0014I Cut generator 0 (Knapsack) - 4 row cuts average 12.2 elements, 0 column cuts (0 active)  in 0.159 seconds - new frequency is 1
Cbc0003I Exiting on maximum nodes
Cbc0005I Partial search - best objective 1e+50 (best possible 12225.487), took 43 iterations and 0 nodes (6.56 seconds)
Cbc0035I Maximum depth 0, 0 variables fixed on reduced cost
Cuts at root node changed objective from 12225.5 to 12225.5
Knapsack was tried 1 times and created 4 cuts of which 0 were active after adding rounds of cuts (0.159 seconds)

Result - Stopped on node limit
