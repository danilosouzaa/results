Cbc0031I 168 added rows had average density of 2.0654762
Cbc0013I At root node, 168 cuts changed objective from 2135657.6 to 2169403.8 in 1 passes
Cbc0014I Cut generator 0 (Knapsack) - 261 row cuts average 2.1 elements, 0 column cuts (0 active)  in 0.063 seconds - new frequency is 1
Cbc0003I Exiting on maximum nodes
Cbc0005I Partial search - best objective 1e+50 (best possible 2169403.8), took 2219 iterations and 0 nodes (11.54 seconds)
