seconds was changed from 1e+100 to 1200
Continuous objective value is 0 - 1.09 seconds
Cbc0031I 11 added rows had average density of 37.454545
Cbc0013I At root node, 11 cuts changed objective from 0 to 0 in 1 passes
Cbc0014I Cut generator 0 (Knapsack) - 26 row cuts average 38.9 elements, 0 column cuts (0 active)  in 0.074 seconds - new frequency is 1
Cbc0003I Exiting on maximum nodes
Cbc0005I Partial search - best objective 1e+50 (best possible 0), took 393 iterations and 0 nodes (1.51 seconds)
Cbc0035I Maximum depth 0, 0 variables fixed on reduced cost
Cuts at root node changed objective from 0 to 0
Knapsack was tried 1 times and created 26 cuts of which 0 were active after adding rounds of cuts (0.074 seconds)

Result - Stopped on node limit
