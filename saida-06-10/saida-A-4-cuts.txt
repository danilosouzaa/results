seconds was changed from 1e+100 to 1200
Continuous objective value is 43.8936 - 24.05 seconds
Cbc0031I 7 added rows had average density of 8.4285714
Cbc0013I At root node, 7 cuts changed objective from 43.893576 to 45.398082 in 1 passes
Cbc0014I Cut generator 0 (Knapsack) - 18 row cuts average 7.8 elements, 0 column cuts (0 active)  in 0.057 seconds - new frequency is 1
Cbc0003I Exiting on maximum nodes
Cbc0005I Partial search - best objective 1e+50 (best possible 45.398082), took 2261 iterations and 0 nodes (29.90 seconds)
Cbc0035I Maximum depth 0, 0 variables fixed on reduced cost
Cuts at root node changed objective from 43.8936 to 45.3981
Knapsack was tried 1 times and created 18 cuts of which 0 were active after adding rounds of cuts (0.057 seconds)

Result - Stopped on node limit
