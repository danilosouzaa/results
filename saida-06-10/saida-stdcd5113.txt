seconds was changed from 1e+100 to 1200
Continuous objective value is -6.42168e+08 - 1.42 seconds
Cutoff increment increased from 0.0001 to 0.9999
Cbc0031I 5 added rows had average density of 7.2
Cbc0013I At root node, 5 cuts changed objective from -6.4216796e+08 to -6.4216594e+08 in 1 passes
Cbc0014I Cut generator 0 (Knapsack) - 5 row cuts average 7.2 elements, 0 column cuts (0 active)  in 0.054 seconds - new frequency is 1
Cbc0003I Exiting on maximum nodes
Cbc0005I Partial search - best objective 1e+50 (best possible -6.4216594e+08), took 14 iterations and 0 nodes (1.72 seconds)
Cbc0035I Maximum depth 0, 0 variables fixed on reduced cost
Cuts at root node changed objective from -6.42168e+08 to -6.42166e+08
Knapsack was tried 1 times and created 5 cuts of which 0 were active after adding rounds of cuts (0.054 seconds)
