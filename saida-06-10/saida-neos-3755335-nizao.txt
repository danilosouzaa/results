seconds was changed from 1e+100 to 1200
Continuous objective value is 50.0302 - 0.83 seconds
Cbc0031I 35 added rows had average density of 2
Cbc0013I At root node, 35 cuts changed objective from 50.030157 to 50.030157 in 1 passes
Cbc0014I Cut generator 0 (Knapsack) - 37 row cuts average 2.0 elements, 0 column cuts (0 active)  in 0.151 seconds - new frequency is 1
Cbc0003I Exiting on maximum nodes
Cbc0005I Partial search - best objective 1e+50 (best possible 50.030157), took 43 iterations and 0 nodes (1.99 seconds)
Cbc0035I Maximum depth 0, 0 variables fixed on reduced cost
Cuts at root node changed objective from 50.0302 to 50.0302
Knapsack was tried 1 times and created 37 cuts of which 0 were active after adding rounds of cuts (0.151 seconds)

Result - Stopped on node limit
