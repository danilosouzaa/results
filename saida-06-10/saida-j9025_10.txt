seconds was changed from 1e+100 to 1200
Continuous objective value is 1.42109e-14 - 3.33 seconds
Cutoff increment increased from 0.0001 to 0.9999
Cbc0031I 5 added rows had average density of 9
Cbc0013I At root node, 5 cuts changed objective from 1.4210855e-14 to 1.4210855e-14 in 1 passes
Cbc0014I Cut generator 0 (Knapsack) - 11 row cuts average 11.1 elements, 0 column cuts (0 active)  in 0.015 seconds - new frequency is 1
Cbc0003I Exiting on maximum nodes
Cbc0005I Partial search - best objective 1e+50 (best possible 1.4210855e-14), took 2306 iterations and 0 nodes (6.11 seconds)
Cbc0035I Maximum depth 0, 0 variables fixed on reduced cost
Cuts at root node changed objective from 1.42109e-14 to 1.42109e-14
Knapsack was tried 1 times and created 11 cuts of which 0 were active after adding rounds of cuts (0.015 seconds)
