seconds was changed from 1e+100 to 1200
Continuous objective value is 935.922 - 31.58 seconds
Cbc0013I At root node, 0 cuts changed objective from 935.92182 to 935.92182 in 1 passes
Cbc0014I Cut generator 0 (Knapsack) - 0 row cuts average 0.0 elements, 0 column cuts (0 active)  in 0.041 seconds - new frequency is 1000
Cbc0003I Exiting on maximum nodes
Cbc0005I Partial search - best objective 1e+50 (best possible 935.92182), took 0 iterations and 0 nodes (31.79 seconds)
Cbc0035I Maximum depth 0, 0 variables fixed on reduced cost
Cuts at root node changed objective from 935.922 to 935.922
Knapsack was tried 1 times and created 0 cuts of which 0 were active after adding rounds of cuts (0.041 seconds)

Result - Stopped on node limit
