seconds was changed from 1e+100 to 1200
Continuous objective value is 7.6348 - 0.04 seconds
Cutoff increment increased from 0.0001 to 0.9999
Cbc0045I 20 integer variables out of 960 objects (960 integer) have cost of 1 - high priority
Cbc0045I branch on satisfied N create fake objective Y random cost Y
Cbc0031I 11 added rows had average density of 23.545455
Cbc0013I At root node, 11 cuts changed objective from 7.6348039 to 7.6348039 in 1 passes
Cbc0014I Cut generator 0 (Knapsack) - 18 row cuts average 28.4 elements, 0 column cuts (0 active)  in 0.021 seconds - new frequency is 1
Cbc0003I Exiting on maximum nodes
Cbc0005I Partial search - best objective 1e+50 (best possible 7.6348039), took 91 iterations and 0 nodes (0.09 seconds)
Cbc0035I Maximum depth 0, 0 variables fixed on reduced cost
Cuts at root node changed objective from 7.6348 to 7.6348
Knapsack was tried 1 times and created 18 cuts of which 0 were active after adding rounds of cuts (0.021 seconds)
